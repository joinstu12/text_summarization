I don't know of any screenreaders or speaking browsers that support aural style sheets. 
Does anyone? 
Thanks, 
I also know of a project that may soon produce another one.

&gt; Emacspeak. 
Will this run on Windows (using Cygwin?)? 
pwwebspeak used to use them. 
Well, there is apparently a project to make it run under Windows in Japanese as well as english, but my japanese is not good enough to read the explanation pages. 
Anyone out there who can help?
