I was talking to a friend today  an amateur web developer and professional disability rights advocate  who complained that the W3C guidelines are overly technical for her needs. 
She wants a plain language version of the guidelines. 
As she is fairly technologically savvy, she expressed frustration at having to work so hard to understand what must be done to make accessible web pages. 
To illustrate her point, she read me the Quick Tip card description of Image map. 
But not everyone who develops web pages speaks the language of clientside servers and hotspots. 
I would guess that most people who develop web pages are amateurs (in the original sense of the word: from amore or amour: an activity done out of love.) 
Will these people freeze when they read &quot;make line by line reading sensible?&quot; or &quot;Use CSS?&quot; 
How about we create a &quot;userfriendly&quot; version of the Web Content guidelines? 
you are not the first to ask about this...
this si a part of obtaining buyin from the user community so implementation will go easier. 
Remember my comments from toronto last year, &quot;create a wcag for dummies&quot; version.... 
hey, are there going to be EO, WAI and WCAG meetings at the www9?

Would you take that as an action item? 
What about the WCAG Curriculum? 
Particularly the Example Set of the WCAG Curriculum? 
Curriculum: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/ 
Example set: http://www.starlingweb.com/wai/wcag/sam10.htm 
Please note that the curriculum will be moving to W3C space in the next week or so. 
Don't bookmark pages in the above site as they will soon be invalid. 
Once the curriculum is in the W3C space, WAI EO will likely start promoting it more heavily. 
Please take a look at www.peepo.com/access for a first small attempt at this. 
(as in QED) and post the URI so we can take a look.
