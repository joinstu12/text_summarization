I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ??? 
But I can confirm that it is a nice place to have a meeting, and could probably attend (it is not that hard to get to from Europe). 
If we can plan, what about planning the year, Australia included? 
This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th. 
Matt May and Charles can confirm the good place for conference and holiday :) 
ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them. 
For 2004, when u prefer (best in mayjuly) we can host in Venice the F2F. 
I have never had a holiday in Venice, although I would like to. 
I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th). 
We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html. 
Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor? 
I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home. 
maybe we could go there? 
Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings. 
Any time or venue should be fine with me. 
I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it. 
I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints.

Could we be careful to make the dates so that those of us who do come a long way can make it, please! 
 maybe northern winter from others' perspectives? 
What are your thoughts? 
Thanks, Tim Boland NIST
