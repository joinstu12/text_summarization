I'd use Netscape 3.x and 4.x, a version of MS Internet Explorer (as you can't have two versions on the same machine to my knowledge), a text browser such as lynx., PwWebSpeak for the voice browser and maybe Opera if you have extra time and money. 
I'm seeking your opinion about what tools we should test with. 
I need to help assemble and populate a small computer lab to examine web usability issues. 
Ok, who has some good reference URLs for WebTV?
Use of tools such as bobby and HTML validators is also essential. 
This is a very large ballpark and I need to narrow the options we're going to explore.  
I'd like to hear about your opinions and preferences about tools if you care to share them. 
For browsers I would look at Lynx, a screen reader (eg winvision, or jaws) and a proper audio browser like pwWebSpeak. 
We have to start someplace and picking a specific set of tools seems to be a reasonable place. 
It might be sensible to have disabled users actually do the testing.  
I'm replying publicly because this is an important issue which is facing a lot of people, not just you. 
The first thing I would do is validate the HTML and check with Bobby, but read the results and think about it rather than simply believing what you're told.

I gather that there's no such thing as a perfect list but I need to put one together anyway.

I would skip IE/Netscape, since designers worth 2c can tell you already how things work there by reading the code.
