I was talking to a friend today  an amateur web developer and professional disability rights advocate  who complained that the W3C guidelines are overly technical for her needs. 
As she is fairly technologically savvy, she expressed frustration at having to work so hard to understand what must be done to make accessible web pages. 
I would guess that most people who develop web pages are amateurs (in the original sense of the word: from amore or amour: an activity done out of love.) 
Will these people freeze when they read &quot;make line by line reading sensible?&quot; or &quot;Use CSS?&quot; 
How about we create a &quot;userfriendly&quot; version of the Web Content guidelines? 
you are not the first to ask about this...
this si a part of obtaining buyin from the user community so implementation will go easier.

&gt; To illustrate her point, she read me the Quick Tip card description of Image map. 
&gt; I agree with her, the tone is definitely geeky.

Particularly the Example Set of the WCAG Curriculum? 
Once the curriculum is in the W3C space, WAI EO will likely start promoting it more heavily.
