I think we should try to design guidelines that do not forbid anything  but 
rather tell people how to do things so that they will be accessible.

I agree with this approach. Consistent with this approach, I feel, 
is a methodology of &quot;guiding&quot; which says &quot;well, you can do it, but 
to do it right you have to do (x), (y), and (z), and that will still 
to follow that path, they at least will be aware of the consequences 
I think even WCAG 1.0 can be regarded as consistent with this method of 
the guidelines that would limit the capacity of content creators to design 
web sites that fulfill their respective purposes.
As soon as you &quot;forbid&quot; something, you find out that some disabled group 
need to explain the consequences, and let the author decide what is most 
appropriate for his/her site.

&amp;gt; As soon as you &quot;forbid&quot; something, you find out that some 
&amp;gt; at an opposite end of some spectrum &quot;needs&quot; what you've forbidden ... we 
&amp;gt; need to explain the consequences, and let the author decide what is most 
&amp;gt; appropriate for his/her site. 
considerations, beyond those of blind people (which are generally 
wellexplored these days), is pretty skimpy. We're still in the 
exploration/discovery process of &quot;what works&quot;, and as we see more 
solutions like Reef's  which allow you to build an interface for 
Forbidding them outright will cause a lot of problems, in the same 
way that alternate interfaces stated &quot;as a last resort&quot; cause problems 
when usable, accessible design is your &quot;first resort&quot;!
