Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call. 
I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that. 
I would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that regularly attends the teleconference. 
This needs to take into account European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North American time. 
3pm EST would be 5am in Australia and 9pm in Europe. 
 I do appreciate this gesture. 
10pm Central European Time means I can make some of the calls, but not all of them, but I understand the change.

She'll be back and able to speak for her own schedule next week. 
When did you need to make a firm decision?

does it help to have different times? 
 boring but maybe better for actual events? 
I'm comfortable with whatever time is set and will remain flexible, even if it's 5:00am PDT.
