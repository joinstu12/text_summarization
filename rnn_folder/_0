I've heard that if you create a page with alt tags and bring it into word to edit it and then export it back to html that the alts are stripped? 
can anyone confirm or deny this?

 Start with an HTML document, created by any means. 
 The HTML doc is opened in Word and some text on the page is changed or added. 
I daresay that most people don't know HTML and are not going to learn it so that they can make an accessible page through a text editor. 
This is especially true if the only editing required of them is small such as changing the grammar on a web page or correcting spelling of a word. 
This is exactly why the authoring tools aspect of the WAI is so important.  
> PS: *Why* would you use Word to edit an HTML document?!  
For example, you can quickly move entire lines or paragraphs without using the clipboard;  
and undo and redo 100 levels. 
All of the above can be done using keyboard and pointandclick techniques. 
Unfortunately, many of the really powerful Word commands are extremely poorly documented.  
Why use Word? 
I think that is exactly what needs to be tested.

I could *not* recreate the problem described when I tested this on my own system using MS Word 97 for Windows. 
I opened the HTML file in Word97, added one word to the text of the Heading, then saved the file back to HTML with a new name. 
The ALT= text was not affected. 
MS Word 97, at least, seems to recognize HTML and preserve it. 
Obviously, other versions of Word may behave differently. 
I suspect that *any* word processor would strip the ALT= text if you first save the document in its *native* format, then try to save it back to HTML.

On the other hand, there was a lost of longdesc, link, and others new HTML4 table attributes; 
in fact, in looks like unknown attributes are pruned out, which shouldn't happen (unknown elements are kept, albeit mess up with, see below)  
The DOCTYPE and the STYLE I had in this test file were moved from the top and the head to the body, which is really bad.
