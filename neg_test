but I 've missed it so far . 
But I mean , it , in the back of my mind , it always bothers me . 
And what happens if it , you know , if it , if they catch it , 
they think that I 'm , you know , I 'm on drugs 
and they send me and , and have me , uh , you know , go through this , this , 
But it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that . Um , 
I agree that , that some innocent person might be victimized , 
by a false test , but I would think that , um , that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that . 
For example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going , 
Because , um , there are , there must be people like you , or in other circumstances , that could come up with , with , uh , false positives for certain kind of drugs . 
On the other hand , um , I think there 's certainly some professions that ought to be tested -- 
But , um , in many , many cases whether or not an individual has a problem with drugs , it 's not even going to effect anybody but his , uh , you know , himself and his own family , perhaps , um , depending on the kind of drug he might be on . 
But , um , and eventually that 's going to show up anyway in the way he works , 
and so on . But there 's so many things that it would make a difference . 
I guess I , I , uh , I would not want to have anyone in my family , uh , victimized by someone who , you know , a , a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , um , you know , had n't been tested . 
Well , I , you know , I 'm , like I said , I 'm , I 'm very much pro testing , um , 
and , and this is why . 
Uh , number one is I , I 'm , I 'm kind of , 
I know this sounds like a slogan for the government , 
but I , you know , we are in a war against , 
drugs . I mean -- 
-- it 's , it 's horrible . I mean , you do n't know whether the person sitting next to you -- 
and it takes some drastic steps at this point . 
And I think , personally , the drastic step has to be that , um , that you ca n't work if you continue taking drugs . 
I mean , it 's as simple as that . 
I mean , make it so , 
Well , make it , uh , ma- , not necessarily difficult , but make it so that it 's not glamorous . 
I mean , it 's glamorous taking drugs , 
or at least it seems that way . 
you hear . The people who , um , have serious problems , I mean , 
really I guess we 're kind of lucky . 
We really only know of one , uh , young man who , uh , who 's a fam- , 
they go to our church , 
and it 's the son and so on , 
and he was friends with my children um , 
and he 's really the only one that I know of personally who got himself really messed up , um , ha , having been involved with drugs . 
But I know of a number of other people who have , you know , gotten all messed up . 
Most of these are young people . 
I work in the education system 
and so I have a little more contact with that . 
But , um , the effect that it 's had on this young man 's life is so dramatic that it 's heartbreaking -- 
-- and he may never really be a productive member of society . 
But sadder than that , he may never be able to have a normal , happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are , are almost uncontrollable . 
I mean , he , he puts himself in the hospital fairly regularly thinking that , you know , he , he 's not sure if he 's going try to commit suicide or not . 
I mean , he 's , you know , he 's so messed up . 
And , um , this was a nice , sweet , young man who , teenager , you know , 
and he 's now a young man about twenty , I guess , who , um , just got really down the wrong path . 
And , uh , you know , I do n't know that , that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing . 
But seeing what drugs did to him makes me see , makes me realize what it could do to people , you know , in the work force as well . 
Um , it 's horrible . 
Well , the limits , uh , uh , would , I think , have to do with what I 'd alluded to before , that there needs to be a further , um , that , that one positive on a drug test , 
In other words , there needs to be , um , more than , 
there needs to be more than one test , 
and there needs to be some , some measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . 
There are lots of things that are involved there , um , such as , perhaps , insurance -- 
-- uh , you know , denial of insurance for someone , um , and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this , um , that would , that , you know , 
it would be unfair , 
and people who are on medication , for example , or , um , even people who might be of the gay community , 
and I 'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society , 
but , um , I think that there does n't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination -- 
because it makes a bigger problem . Um , 
so it seems to me that , that , um , there needs to be some ground , you know , some rules -- 
-- that protect . I 'm not sure , though , when we talk about what rules , if any , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have to be tested . 
I really do n't see why , 
Personally , I think that 's what I was about to say -- 
I do n't , 
I do n't know why it would be , you know , uh , bad to test just every- , and it may be , you know , 
it 's not feasible to do everyone , 
but certainly random testing , the fact that people know that , that they , 
would be some measure of protection . 
But the bottom line is that , that if , if you 're going to stay clean and straight , then , um , you 're , you 're going to do that because you want to . 
Well , there 's , yeah , there , there 's going to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever , 
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want . 
Well , it sounds like we agree , anyway . 
I think so . 
I think we , I think we did pretty good . 
well , uh , I guess that 's about it . 
I guess if that 's all we 've done 
and I guess we 've talked long enough . 
well we just finished watching , uh , TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES on tape , you know . 
we , we 've seen that , 
it was great , 
I thought it was very well done . 
We , we saw , an , we liked it 
but , you know , I did n't think it was as good as all the , uh , hype was about it . 
I feel the same way about that too . 
It was okay . 
I , I could n't see it worth getting a nomination for , uh , best picture . 
the most recent ones that I 've seen are those two , GHOST and , uh , DANCES WITH WOLVES , 
but I rent , uh , uh , videos , 
I keep , you know , um , you know , there 's like three movies that I , I keep telling myself that I should see one of these , you know , some day that I have n't seen , you know , that , that are classics , you know . 
Because I 've never seen CITIZEN KANE , 
that was good . 
and never seen , I 've never seen CASABLANCA and never seen GONE WITH THE WIND . 
I think I 've seen most of Humphrey Bogart 's movies , but , in , in , you know a long time ago , 
and , uh , like the MALTESE FALCON and all those , uh , uh , 
we saw part of THE AFRICAN QUEEN on , on T V a couple of years ago , 
that was good , 
and I 've , I 've alwa- , I 've been wanting to see all of it 
but we just , you know , we walk into the video store 
and we 're like well why do n't we go see this now , 
one of the movies we saw recently , we saw , uh , MISERY . 
Oh , I did n't see that one . 
That was good , um , 
oh , it was great . 
you think , you know , for a Stephen , you know , it because it was by Stephen King it would be really gory 
but there 's only one , 
well there 's a couple scenes , at , at the end there 's , there is , you know some blood and everything 
and there 's one really bad scene where it 's , I mean , there 's not blood but it 's pretty graphic . 
But it 's , um , it 's a really good movie , um . 
he 's a writer 
and , um , she 's his biggest fan 
and she 's also , 
we have n't , um , 
I saw that one , 
that one was n't that great either . 
I heard like mixed reviews , um , of that , 
That 's , that 's on our list of things to see . 
I , I wanted to see , 
I , I was curious if you had seen it 
our big thing is , um , 
you know , mo- , movie prices up here 
I think it 's like six bucks now in the theaters , 
you know , a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees 
and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape . 
That 's us too , 
I know , it 's too bad that they 've gotten so expensive . 
well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was , uh , EDWARD SCISSORHANDS . 
Oh , it was great . 
it was , 
I thought it was kind of maybe for kids more , than ad- , 
it 's , um , it 's an odd film 
and it 's really interesting that , 
I like the director a lot , um , a guy named Tim Burton . 
I , 
well if you , if you liked BEETLEJUICE you 'll probably like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS , 
if you did n't like BEETLEJUICE you 'll probably wo n't like EDWARD SCISSORHANDS . 
he 's , a very odd , odd man 
I think he 's very interesting 
and , uh , I liked those two movies of his a lot . 
He did BATMAN also , which , you know . 
that was pretty good , though , really . 
When you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies , you know . 
You see it for , uh , you know a couple of hours or an hour 
there 's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars , 
Um , do n't really know ,
