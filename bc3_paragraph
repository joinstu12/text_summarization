_mail0_1.1 The IETF meetings tend to become too large, creating logistics and planning problems. 
_mail0_1.2 I suggest that future meetings are held for two weeks, with applications and user services issues the first week, and all other issues the second week. 
_mail0_1.3 Those who so wish could attend both weeks, and other people could attend only one week. 
_mail0_1.4 Those who choose to attend both weeks would be able to cover more groups and do better liaisons between the different areas. 
_mail0_1.5 The Friday of the first week could discuss applications issues which might be of special interest to the other areas, and the Monday of the second week would schedule other groups which might be of special interest to applications people, so some people could attend MondayMonday or FridayFriday.  
_mail0_1.8 for more info see URL: http://www.dsv.su.se/~jpalme
_mail0_2.2 My problem over the past year or so is that there are only a few session I wish to attend, but I cannot know for sure when they will be scheduled, so I cannot make reasonable travel arrangements (a week in Orlando for 6 hours of meetings is hard to sell to management). 
_mail0_2.3 Now I know there is a rationale here, and that one is encouraged to participate broadly. 
_mail0_2.4 And I am hopeful that new activities (my own and in the IETF) will give me many more reasons to attend.  
_mail0_2.5 But firmer scheduling would be a big win.

_mail0_3.1 Terry,  
_mail0_3.2 WG Chairs already are asked to specify which clashes they want to avoid, but clash avoidance is an iterative problem. 
_mail0_3.3 I just don't see how late changes can be completely avoided. 
_mail0_3.4 Obviously, everybody knows they need to be minimised.  
_mail0_3.5 Jacob,  
_mail0_3.6 No way. 
_mail0_3.7 Taking one week out of our calendars 3 times a year is already very painful, and a lot of people really do need and want to track multiple areas of the IETF. 
_mail0_3.8 Spreading it thinner would be awful.

_mail0_4.1 Working groups don't seem to decide at the last minute whether or not they need a meeting, or what their conflict avoidance criteria needs to be. 
_mail0_4.2 This leads me to believe that we could create the IETF schedule earlier without causing significant pain.  
_mail0_4.3 For example, it would be very useful so that the final WG schedule was available more than 21 days in advance, in order to get advanced purchase tickets. 
_mail0_4.4 This would mean that the apps area schedule should be set tentatively 3035 days in advance, so that the draft IETF schedule could be published and conflicts reviewed.  
_mail0_4.5 Larry
_mail0_5.3 I'd like to second this notion. 
_mail0_5.4 Many folks in smaller companies are under severe budget constraints and have difficulty justifying participation in IETF meetings. 
_mail0_5.5 The advance notice helps reduce travel costs, which in turn helps more people attend.  
_mail0_5.6 It would make my life easier.

_mail1_1.1 hi all,  
_mail1_1.2 As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups. 
_mail1_1.3 I wrote to the wwwrdfinterest list asking for data:  
_mail1_1.5 so we'll have to see how that pans out. 
_mail1_1.6 Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples).  
_mail1_1.7 There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples:  
_mail1_1.9 So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on. 
_mail1_1.10 We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require. 
_mail1_1.11 At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like:  
_mail1_1.13 which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours);  
_mail1_1.14 and http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg  
_mail1_1.15 which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though).  
_mail1_1.16 Do people have a preference for one style over the other?  
_mail1_1.17 Could you let us know today if possible? 
_mail1_1.18 We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003.  
_mail1_1.19 thanks,  
_mail1_1.20 Libby  
_mail1_1.21 p.s. Here's a nice similar idea:  
_mail1_2.4 Can't say I'm particularly grabbed by either of them, but if you have to pick one I'd go for the map, not the globe. 
_mail1_2.5 Is there any reason it has to be geographically accurate? 
_mail1_2.6 Perhaps a schematic, analogous to the London Underground map of London, would allow you to convey the sense of spatial distribution without getting hung up on the scale problem. 
_mail1_2.7 Of course, you may not consider that a helpful suggestion given the short timescale :)  
_mail1_2.8 Cheers,  
_mail1_2.9 Ian
_mail1_3.10 One advantage of being geographically accurate is it simplifies our lives when we try to plot SW researchers, groups, events etc on the map...  
_mail1_3.11 I prefer the map to the globe, fwiw.  
_mail1_3.12 Dan
_mail1_4.1 yeah, sorry it's such a rush. 
_mail1_4.2 It took a long time to write the document explaining how to write the RDF. 
_mail1_4.3 At this stage we really need examples to show the designer though 
_mail1_4.4  I'll pass your comments along to him, see if he has anything like that.  
_mail1_4.5 What don't you like about them in particular?

_mail3_1.1 We are trying to do advanced planning for a F2F in September.  
_mail3_1.2 Because of the membership overlap with the OASIS BPEL TC, we would like to try and colocate with their meetings. 
_mail3_1.3 This is not a joint meeting, and is being proposed purely to ease travel logistics and members' costs.  
_mail3_1.4 The OASIS TC is proposing to meet 17 (afternoon), 18, and 19 September, either in Seattle or Germany. 
_mail3_1.5 Thus it makes sense to try and meet on 15, 16, and 17 (Morning) September.  
_mail3_1.6 Can people check their diaries for these dates and inform the chairs asap.

_mail4_6.1 There has been very little comment either way on this at the meeting or on the list. 
_mail4_6.2 The problem is that W3C rules require 6 weeks notice of meetings which I believe applies to time and location. 
_mail4_6.3 Assuming this is true, I think we have to go with the UC Irvine location unless we want to postpone the meeting....

_mail4_7.1 Pesonally  If we are going to do "it" in Washington State, My vote is for Seattle rather than Redmond, unless we are are all camping at "Bill's new place on the lake" and you are making arrangements to have us shuttle in from SeaTac to the private Microsoft Airport. 
_mail4_7.2 Staging in Seattle saves the bulk of us the drive out to Redmond.  
_mail4_7.3 I myself would rather see us there staying at someplace like the Edgewater than in Redmond by far. 
_mail4_7.4 It's really easier to get to and has more nightlife, etc etc etc. 
_mail4_7.5 A number of us have personal experience of the Edgewater's facilities from one of last year's ISC Meetings we had there.  
_mail4_7.6 Very good site and lots of reasoably priced facilities in the area and Pikes Market Arcade Area is a hop, skip, and a jump away.  
_mail4_7.7 Otherwise, by my vote  Sourthern California is fine by me.

_mail4 Having not heard from anyone else, I am going with the Univ. of Calif. at Irvine locations. Further logistic information will be posted as soon as it is available.  Thanks,  Donald  =====================================================================  Donald E.

I can offer to hold the meeting here at Microsoft if the wg prefers Seattle at that time. Yes, the sun has been known to shine here in August :  ) Either location is OK with me btw.  Barb  Original Message  Has the decision been made, or should I express my preference for Seattle? :)  Mark  Original Message  Only if we can go to a certain shop, Barb knows what I am talking about :)  Peter  Dr. Peter Lipp  IAIK, TU Graz  Email Peter.Lipp@iaik.at  Phone +43 316 873 5513  Fax +43 316 873 5510  Web http://jcewww.iaik.tugraz.ac.at  application/xpkcs7signature attachment: smime.p7sI'll check into that Peter :  )  Barb  Original Message  There has been very little comment either way on this at the meeting or on the list. The problem is that W3C rules require 6 weeks notice of meetings which I believe applies to time and location. Assuming this is true, I think we have to go with the UC Irvine location unless we want to postpone the meeting....  Donald  Donald E.

Staging in Seattle saves the bulk of us the drive out to Redmond.  I myself would rather see us there staying at someplace like the Edgewater than in Redmond by far. It's really easier to get to and has more nightlife, etc etc etc. A number of us have personal experience of the Edgewater's facilities from one of last year's ISC Meetings we had there.  Very good site and lots of reasoably priced facilities in the area and Pikes Market Arcade Area is a hop, skip, and a jump away.  Otherwise, by my vote  Sourthern California is fine by me.

_mail5_1.1 I propose to cancel this weeks telecon and schedule another for 12 Mar 2004, if needed. 
_mail5_1.2 I would like to get moving on comments on the TAG architecture document. 
_mail5_1.3 Jan  are you still up for reviewing? 
_mail5_1.4 Can we aim to get other comments in by the end of this week and agreement by email next week? 
_mail5_1.5 Brian
_mail5_2.6 I think that means we will not formally respond to I18N on the charmod comments, shall I tell them that we do not intend to, but that the email discussion has not shown any disagreement. 
_mail5_2.7 e.g. I have informed the RDF Core WG of your decisions, and no one has indicated unhappiness 
_mail5_2.8  however we have not formally discussed these issues; 
_mail5_2.9 and are not likely to. 
_mail5_2.10 Jeremy
_mail5_3.7 Ah. 
_mail5_3.8 Is this a problem. 
_mail5_3.9 Have I understood correctly they are going through last call again anyway. 
_mail5_3.14 When is the deadline? 
_mail5_3.15 I'm prepared to decide by email so we can formally respond by email. 
_mail5_3.16 Brian
_mail5_4.2 Im assuming that they are all cancelled unless I hear otherwise. 
_mail5_4.3 Maybe that should be our default? 
_mail5_4.6 I still plan to write a rather long diatribe on this if I can find the time. 
_mail5_4.7 I doubt if the rest of the WG will endorse all of it but I will send it along asap, hopefully some time next week.

_mail5_5.2 Patrick 
_mail5_6.4 Yes  
_mail5_6.5 I could change my draft informal response to indicate that if we have any other formal response it will be included in our LC review comments on their new documents. 
_mail5_6.12 Two weeks from when I received the message .... 
_mail5_6.13 i.e. during Cannes 
_mail5_6.14  I suspect that is also the real deadline, in that I imagine they want to make their final decisions at Cannes

_mail6_1.1 I've got an opportunity to do some fun family stuff this Friday, so I'd like to know whether it conflicts with an RDF Core telcon. 
_mail6_1.2 I haven't seen notice, and we're less than 7 days away, so I presume there's no WG telcon this week. 
_mail6_1.3 Sorry if I missed an announcement to that effect. 
_mail6_1.4 If the WG meets, I suppose it'll be somewhat unofficially. 
_mail6_1.5 In that case, I offer regrets. 
_mail6_1.7 Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
_mail6_2.1 Hmm, 
_mail6_2.2 I was just wondering that myself. 
_mail6_2.3 I see the following possible agenda items for a telecon: 
_mail6_2.4 a) wording changes to the semantics doc 
_mail6_2.5 b) advice to the CG about what to do about postponed issues 
_mail6_2.6 Dan, would you like the WG to meet to discuss/approve the proposed wording changes? 
_mail6_2.7 Will the 16th be soon enough? 
_mail6_2.8 Eric, is the CG seeking input from the WG about b). 
_mail6_2.9 WG, do folks want to meet to discuss a), b) or anything else? 
_mail6_2.10 I will send a formal notification of a telecon for 16th Jan, but will cancel if its not needed. 
_mail6_2.11 Dan, I hope you have fun on Friday. 
_mail6_2.12 Brian 
_mail6_2.19 Dan Connolly, W3C http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
_mail6_3.9 Yes. 
_mail6_3.10 This issue was on last Monday's SWCG agenda but time ran out before we were able to discuss this. 
_mail6_3.11 The need isn't urgent (e.g. no need to have a rdfcore call just for this issue) but should be addressed some time by the end of the month.

_mail6_4.9 Good question, but I haven't done the relevant calendar research to figure it out. 
_mail6_4.10 EricM, I leave that to you. 
_mail6_4.11 Call/page me if you'd like help. 
_mail6_4.16 Likewise. 1/2 ;)

_mail6_5.2 Personally I prefer not to discuss postponed issues (for new recs?) until we've got this one in the bag. 
_mail6_5.3 As HP rep the position I represented was we did not need to resolve these issues in this standardization round. 
_mail6_5.4 For the next few weeks that remains the position I wish to represent. 
_mail6_5.5 When we get to rec, I have things that I individually think about the postponed issues and could contribute to a discussion. 
_mail6_5.6 Sorry for being so cautious. 
_mail6_5.7 Jeremy
_mail6_6.5 I was not clear. 
_mail6_6.6 I was not proposing we discuss resolutions of the issues, but suggestions to the CG of how/whether these issues might, at some point in the future be resolved. 
_mail6_6.7 For example, the WG might recommend to the CG that some issues are higher priority than others. 
_mail6_6.8 Is that a discussion you feel able to contribute to? 
_mail6_6.9 Brian
_mail6_7.9 I am not sure that we can have a procedural only discussion 
_mail6_7.10  I guess if I am unconfortable I will just stay quiet 
_mail6_7.11  and my silence should not be interpreted as assent. 
_mail6_7.12 For instance, I decided to not reply to Grahams msg on the postponed issues despite disagreeing with it.

_mail7_6.1 Most important  if you haven't registered yet, don't forget. 
_mail7_6.3 Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people want to eat for lunch. 
_mail7_6.4 The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille. 
_mail7_6.5 Possible substitutions: 
_mail7_6.6 baked Scrod (fish) 
_mail7_6.7 chicken caesar salad 
_mail7_6.8 hommus rollup sandwich with salad 
_mail7_6.9 salad with crab cakes 
_mail7_6.10 churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions 
_mail7_6.11 I will do this in the following way: 
_mail7_6.12 If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear. 
_mail7_6.13 It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do. 
_mail7_6.14 The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday. 
_mail7_6.15 No response will not be considered a vote for the default 
_mail7_6.16  it will be considered a vote for &quot;whatever gets chosen&quot;

_mail11_1.1 Don't know how long this meeting is going to take but with a joint meeting &quot;long&quot; seems more likely than &quot;short&quot;. 
_mail11_1.2 So just in case: 
_mail11_1.3 I have another (phone) meeting coming up at 3:30 Boston time (1 hour after this one) so if we haven't finished by then, I'll have leave early. 
_mail11_1.4 Tried to move it but that was just not possible. 
_mail11_1.5 Cheers, 
_mail11_1.6 Marjolein 
_mail11_2.1 Hi all, 
_mail11_2.2 Sorry about the delay, but this is the Techniques draft that I said I would do at the facetoface. 
_mail11_2.3 It is not done but you will get the idea. 
_mail11_2.4 Language specific things have generally been removed (to be put in the separate docs). 
_mail11_2.5 Cheers,

_mail11_4.1 Jan, 
_mail11_4.2 thanks for this 
_mail11_4.3  it's a good piece of work. 
_mail11_4.4 How about we have the following categories: 
_mail11_4.5 + Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) 
_mail11_4.6 + Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) 
_mail11_4.7 + Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint. 
_mail11_4.8 + References 
_mail11_4.9 These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority. 
_mail11_4.10 For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a levelA tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source). 
_mail11_4.11 But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to doubleA. 
_mail11_4.12 A source editing tool can use this technique to any level. 
_mail11_4.13 Cheers

_mail11_5.1 I agree. 
_mail11_5.2 I'd really like to work on emphasizing crossover situations in which doing one thing contributes to meeting several guidelines. 
_mail11_5.3 In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met.

_mail12_1.1 Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call. 
_mail12_1.2 I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that. 
_mail12_1.3 I would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that regularly attends the teleconference. 
_mail12_1.4 This needs to take into account European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North American time. 
_mail12_1.5 How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday? 
_mail12_1.6 This would make it 6:00am in Australia and 9:00 pm in Europe. 
_mail12_1.7 Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion? 
_mail12_1.8 Jutta
_mail12_2.1 According to the International Meeting Planner, Jutta's suggestion of 4pm EST is pretty good 
_mail12_2.2  although it is actually 10pm in Europe. 
_mail12_2.3 3pm EST would be 5am in Australia and 9pm in Europe. 
_mail12_2.5  Jan 
_mail12_3.1 Thank you 
_mail12_3.2  I do appreciate this gesture. 
_mail12_3.6 I believe 4.00pm on Tuesday would clash with the IMS meetings, if they continue at that time...

_mail12_4.1 Hi Jutta, 
_mail12_4.2 The same issue arose a few weeks ago in the PF group. 
_mail12_4.3 It is very difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone.

_mail12_5.2 however, at glancing at her schedule she may have conflicts with this time, at least on Mondays/Wednesdays
_mail12_5.3 Tuesdays look like a 30 minute conflict (at the last 1/2 hour).

_mail13_1.1 We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html. 
_mail13_1.2 ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them. 
_mail13_1.3 I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th). 
_mail13_1.4 Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings. 
_mail13_1.5 This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th. 
_mail13_1.6 Monday is Martin Luther King day. 
_mail13_1.7 What are your thoughts? 
_mail13_1.8 Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor? 
_mail13_1.9 I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it. 
_mail13_1.10 Thanks for your input. 
_mail13_1.11 Jutta 
_mail13_1.12 
_mail13_2.1 I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ??? 
_mail13_2.2 MLK Day is never better than in Savannah! 
_mail13_2.3 maybe we could go there? 
_mail13_2.4 I personally don't want to spend my life in Orlando, thank you! 
_mail13_2.5 I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home. 
_mail13_2.6 I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints. 
_mail13_2.7 Liddy
_mail13_3.1 Any time or venue should be fine with me. 
_mail13_3.2 Thanks, Tim Boland NIST 
_mail13_4.1 For 2004, when u prefer (best in mayjuly) we can host in Venice the F2F.

_mail13 We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html. ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them. I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th). Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings. This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th. Monday is Martin Luther King day. What are your thoughts? Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor? I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it. Thanks for your input. Jutta I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ??? MLK Day is never better than in Savannah! maybe we could go there? I personally don't want to spend my life in Orlando, thank you! I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home. I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints. LiddyAny time or venue should be fine with me. Thanks, Tim Boland NIST For 2004, when u prefer (best in mayjuly) we can host in Venice the F2F.

_mail14_1.1 Hello Education and Outreach Colleagues, 
_mail14_1.2 I was talking to a friend today  an amateur web developer and professional disability rights advocate  who complained that the W3C guidelines are overly technical for her needs. 
_mail14_1.3 She wants a plain language version of the guidelines. 
_mail14_1.4 As she is fairly technologically savvy, she expressed frustration at having to work so hard to understand what must be done to make accessible web pages. 
_mail14_1.5 To illustrate her point, she read me the Quick Tip card description of Image map. 
_mail14_1.6 I agree with her, the tone is definitely geeky. 
_mail14_1.7 But not everyone who develops web pages speaks the language of clientside servers and hotspots. 
_mail14_1.8 I would guess that most people who develop web pages are amateurs (in the original sense of the word: from amore or amour: an activity done out of love.) 
_mail14_1.9 Will these people freeze when they read &quot;make line by line reading sensible?&quot; or &quot;Use CSS?&quot; 
_mail14_1.10 How about we create a &quot;userfriendly&quot; version of the Web Content guidelines? 
_mail14_1.11 Maybe a primer. 
_mail14_1.12 Alan
_mail14_2.1 you are not the first to ask about this...

_mail15_1.1 Welcome to the Web Accessibility Initiative Evaluation and Repair (WAIERIG) Interest Group (not to be confused with the overall WAI Interest Group (WAIIG). 
_mail15_1.2 As you know from the charter, http://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/IG/ we'll be advising the ER Working group on tools for evaluating, repairing, and filtering web sites (some people will be members of both groups). 
_mail15_1.3 In addition to our own knowledge and experience, we'll rely on input from from novice and expert users with disabilities, web authors and administrators, ISP's, content owners, and vendors
_mail15_1.4 some of whom will be ourselves. 
_mail15_1.5 To start out, would you each say a few words about yourself and your involvement in this area? 
_mail15_1.6 I attached my own description below. 
_mail15_1.7 Len 
_mail15_1.8 Here's my own intro: 
_mail15_1.9 Hello. 
_mail15_1.10 I'm Len Kasday. 
_mail15_1.11 I had some opportunity to work on universal design while I was at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Labs, e.g. designing the workstations at our Relay centers to accommodate communications assistants who are sighted, who use Braille, and who use a large screen and magnification. 
_mail15_1.12 I'm now at the Institute on Disabilities at Temple University in Philadelphia. 
_mail15_1.13 Also, I'm chair of this group. 
_mail15_1.14 (When you write about yourself please feel free to be a lot longer or shorter than I was. 
_mail15_1.15 Also, if your official job, i.e. your &quot;day&quot; job, isn't disability related, please mention it if you'd like to. 
_mail15_1.16 It can be very helpful to get a different perspective).

_mail15_2.3 My name is Daniel Dardailler and I work for W3C, acting as overall WAI Project Manager and also chair of the Evaluation&amp;amp;Repair working group (Len is chairing the Interest Group). 
_mail15_2.4 My involvement in Accessibility goes back to 1993 or so, when I started working on X Window Access. 
_mail15_2.5 I started at W3C in 1996 and helped starting and launching the WAI in 1997. 
_mail15_2.6 I think the work we're about to do in these two complementary ER groups is paramount to the success of the WAI. 
_mail15_2.7 Furthermore, I expect the ER IG to be instrumental in defining and refining the exact deliverables of the WG group.
_mail15_3.1 Hi, I'm Al Gilman. 
_mail15_3.2 When I joined the devaccess list I said &quot;I'm a standards reformer, and I have an agenda.&quot; 
_mail15_3.3 Maybe that was a little inyourface, and then maybe I am. 
_mail15_3.4 General background is at &amp;lt;http://www.access.digex.net/~asgilman/&amp;gt; . 
_mail15_3.5 I am wearing at least two hats in this particular context. 
_mail15_3.6 Under one hat I am chairing the WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group. 
_mail15_3.7 I think we need to have some empirical backup for protocol and format suggestions we make in the future. 
_mail15_3.8 So I am looking to this group to brainstorm some things to try, and the ERWG to prototype some of them, so that we can be more confident of our recommendations. 
_mail15_3.9 Under another hat I am on the Trace Center team that will be supporting NSF NPACI webmasters with a toolkit strongly related to the results of the ER teams in the WAI. 
_mail15_3.10 This has led me to be talking with webmasters and web evaluators in the U.S. Federal Government, which is a business headquartered near where I live. 
_mail15_3.11 I have been talking up this group with those folks.

_mail15_6.2 My name is Kitch Barnicle and I work part time at the American Foundation for the Blind in the technology access program. 
_mail15_6.3 When I am not at AFB I live the life of a graduate student. 
_mail15_6.4 At the moment I am in the process of collecting data for my doctoral dissertation, which is basically a usability study of how users of speech interact with GUI elements. 
_mail15_6.5 In general, I am interested in adapting usability testing techniques so that individuals with disabilities can be included in assessments of mainstream technology, including the web. 
_mail15_6.6 Prior to joining AFB in the fall of 1993, I was a manager of evaluations at the federally funded rehabilitation engineering center on the evaluation of assistive technology. 
_mail15_6.7 Though our evaluations primarily focused on mobility related devices such as wheelchairs, scooters and bathroom equipment, I think the experience will prove useful to me in this endeavor.

_mail17_1.1 Question: Does a requirement to use graphics "when appropriate"  something that may not be easily done by users with visual disabilities  mean that blind people are not going to be "good" web designers?  
_mail17_1.2 Especially if we are going to expect them to be skilled in graphical user interface design and understand how to use images to communicate with people with cognitive disabilities?  
_mail17_1.3 If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind designer be able to meet that requirement effectively?  
_mail17_1.4 Just thinking out loud 
_mail17_1.5  don't mind me.

_mail17_2.1 Some would, some wouldn't. 
_mail17_2.2 Same as sighted people. 
_mail17_2.3 For example, some of my blind friends are much more visually capable than I am, and some aren't. 
_mail17_2.4 An analgous question might be to ask whether a blind person is going to be able to adequately describe an image  currently a P1 requirement in a number of situations.

_mail17_3.5 It's not the same, because a blind person can simply choose to not use an image if they feel they can't reasonably describe it...under the current guidelines. 
_mail17_3.6 (This changes when images become a requirement for accessibility.)  
_mail17_3.7 You do bring up a good point, however, that many people who can see are also not "visually capable" and may not be able to provide graphics easily. 
_mail17_3.8 I'm not sure if I can provide decent graphics for my sites 
_mail17_3.9  and I refuse to believe that I need to give up web design because people with CDs (supposedly) need graphics...

_mail17_5.2 There are lots of cases where a blind designer could use graphics as effectively, or actually more effectively, than a sighted person. 
_mail17_5.3 These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way. 
_mail17_5.4 For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process. 
_mail17_5.5 These insure a sensible flow chart... 
_mail17_5.6 at least a chart that "parses" correctly. 
_mail17_5.7 On the other hand, I've seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they're using.
_mail17_5.8 I'll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day.  
_mail17_5.9 Other examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set.  
_mail17_5.10 Also, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards.  
_mail17_5.11 Now, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can't be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules? 
_mail17_5.12 Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines: 
_mail17_5.13 we're just looking at usability and I think rulebased graphics should handle that. 
_mail17_5.14 Second of all, I think there are certainly some blind individuals who can produce better art than some sighted individuals (better than me for example), certainly among people who have some vision and early visual experience. 
_mail17_5.15 As for art by people born blind... I'm not familiar with that area but I woudn't be surprised there's some remarkable use of shape and form.

_mail18_1.1 We are moving forward with holding a face2face meeting in Bristol, England 5 and 6 October. 
_mail18_1.2 It has been proposed that the Authoring Tool Working Group join us to discuss the revision of WCAG on the afternoon of the 6th. 
_mail18_1.3 How do people feel about this opportunity to discuss the current state of the draft with another working group? 
_mail18_1.4 Do you feel we will need the full two days to work on the draft?

_mail18_2.3 WL: I believe that it is mandatory to discuss states of the draft as they are reached to help avoid possible oversights and conflicts. 
_mail18_2.4 I believe that it will take far more than the two full days to work on the draft and that a meeting involving AU will constitute &quot;working on the draft.&quot; 
_mail18_2.5 I may be the only one who's on five (count 'em 5) Working Groups and even though there is some personnel overlap, the groups do &quot;feel&quot; different. 
_mail18_2.6 It (Bristol) is something to look forward to and prepare for. 
_mail18_2.7 I hope it works out because the WAI's influence on the overall W3C and the strengththroughdiversity we're achieving is a great model for just about everything and it's starting to bear fruit.

_mail19_1.1 I am not sure this will hold but 
_mail19_1.2 As a general rule.... 
_mail19_1.3 I think we should try to design guidelines that do not forbid anything  but 
_mail19_1.4 rather tell people how to do things so that they will be accessible.

_mail19_2.6 I agree with this approach. Consistent with this approach, I feel, 
_mail19_2.7 is a methodology of &quot;guiding&quot; which says &quot;well, you can do it, but 
_mail19_2.8 to do it right you have to do (x), (y), and (z), and that will still

_mail19_2.10 WANT TO, hey, it's your choice.&quot; 
_mail19_2.11 This isn't forbidding anything  but it's making it clear that there 
_mail19_2.12 are definite problems with certain approaches, and if someone chooses 
_mail19_2.13 to follow that path, they at least will be aware of the consequences 
_mail19_2.14 of their actions.

_mail19_3.1 I think even WCAG 1.0 can be regarded as consistent with this method of 
_mail19_3.2 specifying guidelines, in that the word &quot;avoid&quot; was deliberately chosen to 
_mail19_3.3 imply the existence of alternative, more accessible, means of achieving 
_mail19_3.4 the same objective. WCAG 2.0 should, however, make this point clearer, to 
_mail19_3.5 avoid (pun intended) giving the impression that there are prohibitions in 
_mail19_3.6 the guidelines that would limit the capacity of content creators to design 
_mail19_3.7 web sites that fulfill their respective purposes.

_mail19_4.2 You make an excellent point! 
_mail19_4.3 As soon as you &quot;forbid&quot; something, you find out that some disabled group

Consistent with this approach, I feel, is a methodology of &quot;guiding&quot; which says &quot;well, you can do it, but to do it right you have to do (x), (y), and (z), and that will still mean you're losing out on (a), (b), and (c), but if you REALLY REALLY WANT TO, hey, it's your choice.&quot; This isn't forbidding anything  but it's making it clear that there are definite problems with certain approaches, and if someone chooses to follow that path, they at least will be aware of the consequences of their actions.

TAKE CONTROL. ________________________________________ I think even WCAG 1.0 can be regarded as consistent with this method of specifying guidelines, in that the word &quot;avoid&quot; was deliberately chosen to imply the existence of alternative, more accessible, means of achieving the same objective. WCAG 2.0 should, however, make this point clearer, to avoid (pun intended) giving the impression that there are prohibitions in the guidelines that would limit the capacity of content creators to design web sites that fulfill their respective purposes.Gregg, You make an excellent point! As soon as you &quot;forbid&quot; something, you find out that some disabled group at an opposite end of some spectrum &quot;needs&quot; what you've forbidden ... we need to explain the consequences, and let the author decide what is most appropriate for his/her site.

Excellent point  the body of knowledge for disability access considerations, beyond those of blind people (which are generally wellexplored these days), is pretty skimpy. We're still in the exploration/discovery process of &quot;what works&quot;, and as we see more solutions like Reef's  which allow you to build an interface for ONE audience without fearing interference with OTHER audiences' interfaces  we will encounter more and more solutions which will &quot;work&quot; for some people and &quot;not work&quot; for others. Forbidding them outright will cause a lot of problems, in the same way that alternate interfaces stated &quot;as a last resort&quot; cause problems when usable, accessible design is your &quot;first resort&quot;!

_mail20_1.1 I have noticed that when using a screen reading browser such as IBM homepage reader when words are joined together for example &quot;homepage&quot; the words &quot;home&quot; and &quot;page&quot; are not recognised, as a consequence the joined words become incomprehensible to the screenreading software. 
_mail20_1.2 I haven't found any references to this within the gudielines. 
_mail20_1.3 have i missed them?
_mail20_2.1 14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate... [priority 1] 
_mail20_2.2 Of course at some point speech technology needs to learn how to deal with common but new terms in a language. 
_mail20_2.3 Homepage is one that I would expect to work  especially in a product whose name includes the term. 
_mail20_2.4 But Text to Speech is an inexact science  even people who are experts cannot agree to pronounce words the same way. 
_mail20_2.5 Just ask a welltrained and very literate American chemist what the eleme whose symbol is Al is called  they tell you about a thing called &quot;aluminum&quot;. 
_mail20_2.6 But they are in fact referring to what any Australian voice recogniser would expect to hear as al(y)amin(i)yum. 
_mail20_2.7 The problem is funnier (after people get over the inconvenience of learning about it) when a screen reader uses a finnish or swedish synthesiser but provides its cues and prompts in english...

_mail20_3.4 No, it's not obvious at all. 
_mail20_3.5 Yes, when in doubt, hypenate compounds if you have any doubt as to how long they have been in the language. 
_mail20_3.6 Some screen readers will successfully divide camelCase agglutinations.

_mail20_3.8 You would have to have the memory of an elephant to pull up the following flames. 
_mail20_3.9 But they do touch on texttospeech, along with lay persons, people operating in a second language, and others with reading difficulty as at risk on account of unusual words including neologisms: 
_mail20_3.12 The point is to have and apply a reasonably small word list and handle those things that fall outside this list as special. 
_mail20_3.13 My spellchecker in Eudora 4 bounces 'homepage' and suggests &quot;home page&quot; as a possible correction.

_mail20_4.1 There is probably a good argument for raising the issue of proper names. 
_mail20_4.2 In my brief experience it seems that common dictionary words are read well enough. 
_mail20_4.3 However it seems that people and place names are not. 
_mail20_4.4 These are the very words that are of greatest interest. 
_mail20_4.5 it would also be great to see a decent ua that offered alternative readings (as per spell checker example), a memorise function, and possibly the opportunity to share the choice with a public database. 
_mail20_4.6 Perhaps somone knows of this? 
_mail20_4.7 thanks
_mail20_5.1 It would appear that this is readily available using Speech synthesis markup language and XSLT (or XSLT 2 perhaps)... 
_mail20_5.2 or someone can make smarter and smarter speech synthessisers.

_mail21_1.1 Quick question. 
_mail21_1.2 In earlier versions of Acrobat, it was not possible to make PDF files accessible if the files were actually developed on a Macintosh.  
_mail21_1.3 Is this still the case with the latest version of Acrobat for the Mac (version 6.0, I believe)?

_mail21_2.2 The Make Accessible command is now available in Acrobat Pro 6.0 for the Mac as well as for Windows.  
_mail21_2.3 Loretta  
_mail21_3.1 A clarification: 
_mail21_3.2 it is available in both Acrobat 6.0 Professional and Acrobat 6.0 Standard, for the Mac and Windows.  
_mail21_4.1 Hello Loretta/Doyle,  
_mail21_4.2 I am just not sure what the Make Accessible feature really does. 
_mail21_4.3 I am a JAWS user and a PDF file is as usable or unusable as it was before I run the Make Accessible feature on it. 
_mail21_4.4 I'll be glad if you can enlighten me on this. 
_mail21_4.5 Sailesh  
_mail21_5.1 Sailesh,  
_mail21_5.2 Make Accessible is a command that attempts to analyze an untagged PDF file and infer logical structure from the marks on the page. 
_mail21_5.3 This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file. 
_mail21_5.4 The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure. 
_mail21_5.5 Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author.  
_mail21_5.6 In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows. 
_mail21_5.7 In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows.  
_mail21_5.8 When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure. 
_mail21_5.9 This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF.

_mail22_1.1 I need to help assemble and populate a small computer lab to examine web usability issues. 
_mail22_1.2 This is a very large ballpark and I need to narrow the options we're going to explore.

_mail22_2.1 I'd use Netscape 3.x and 4.x, a version of MS Internet Explorer (as you can't have two versions on the same machine to my knowledge), a text browser such as lynx., PwWebSpeak for the voice browser and maybe Opera if you have extra time and money. 
_mail22_2.2 Also to be considered is the use of a general screen reader such as Jaws For Windows.

_mail22_3.3 I would skip IE/Netscape, since designers worth 2c can tell you already how things work there by reading the code. 
_mail22_3.4 The first thing I would do is validate the HTML and check with Bobby, but read the results and think about it rather than simply believing what you're told.  
_mail22_3.5 For browsers I would look at Lynx, a screen reader (eg winvision, or jaws) and a proper audio browser like pwWebSpeak. 
_mail22_3.6 If you can, use WebTV and a Macintosh version of things 
_mail22_3.7  this will generally show up the problems much faster.  
_mail22_3.8 The key is to learn where the problems arise so you can cut back the test/repair cycle. 
_mail22_3.9 It is a great efficiency if you can solve the problems by design rather than by repair.

_mail22_6.3 By the way, if you weren't aware, there's an emulator for WebTV that runs on Windows 95/* and Macintosh that you can download from developer.webtv.net.

_mail23_1.1 I recently discovered that ABC Radio National here in Australia (http://www.abc.net.au/rn/) offers transcripts of certain of its programmes via the web. 
_mail23_1.2 I haven't checked the accessibility of the site, and, as I understand it, the transcripts appear several days after the programmes themselves have been broadcast. 
_mail23_1.3 Are other radio stations with a presence on the web adopting similar policies?

_mail24_1.1 I've heard that if you create a page with alt tags and bring it into word to edit it and then export it back to html that the alts are stripped? 
_mail24_1.2 can anyone confirm or deny this?

_mail24_2.6 That's about what I'd expect to happen, with Word or any other wordprocessor. 
_mail24_2.7 I could test this on my system if you can confirm the scenario: 
_mail24_2.8  Start with an HTML document, created by any means. 
_mail24_2.10  The HTML doc is opened in Word and some text on the page is changed or added. 
_mail24_2.11  The page is &quot;Saved as HTML&quot; from Word, without first saving it in Word format. 
_mail24_2.12 PS: *Why* would you use Word to edit an HTML document?! 
_mail24_3.1 Many people required to edit and create web pages and/or sites are not web professionals and the only "WYSIWYG" tool available to them is Word. 
_mail24_3.2 I daresay that most people don't know HTML and are not going to learn it so that they can make an accessible page through a text editor. 
_mail24_3.3 This is especially true if the only editing required of them is small such as changing the grammar on a web page or correcting spelling of a word. 
_mail24_3.4 This is exactly why the authoring tools aspect of the WAI is so important.

_mail24_4.2 MSWord has elegant textediting commands that are absent from a basic text editor, and that make editing documents a pleasure. 
_mail24_4.3 For example, you can quickly move entire lines or paragraphs without using the clipboard;  
_mail24_4.4 select words, sentences, and paragraphs by pressing a single key; 
_mail24_4.5 and undo and redo 100 levels. 
_mail24_4.6 All of the above can be done using keyboard and pointandclick techniques. 
_mail24_4.7 So there is a lot of versatility.  
_mail24_4.8 Unfortunately, many of the really powerful Word commands are extremely poorly documented.  
_mail24_4.9 Furthermore, savvy Word users can create specialpurpose editing commands in Visual Basic to enhance the usefulness of the word processor as a text editor.  
_mail24_4.10 Why use Word? 
_mail24_4.11 Because it is a good tool for the job.

_mail24_7.12 I could *not* recreate the problem described when I tested this on my own system using MS Word 97 for Windows. 
_mail24_7.13 I followed the scenario with a simple test page (created in Netscape Page Composer) with a Heading, one line of text, and an image with ALT= text. 
_mail24_7.14 I opened the HTML file in Word97, added one word to the text of the Heading, then saved the file back to HTML with a new name. 
_mail24_7.15 The ALT= text was not affected. 
_mail24_7.16 MS Word 97, at least, seems to recognize HTML and preserve it. 
_mail24_7.17 Obviously, other versions of Word may behave differently. 
_mail24_7.18 I suspect that *any* word processor would strip the ALT= text if you first save the document in its *native* format, then try to save it back to HTML.

_mail24_8.6 I tried that with Word 97 and there was no lost of ALT.  
_mail24_8.7 I even tried saving the file as .doc format, copying it under a different name.doc, reopening it in Word and saving it in HTML, and the ALT were still present (which proves that the ALT are somehow stored in the doc format)  
_mail24_8.8 On the other hand, there was a lost of longdesc, link, and others new HTML4 table attributes; 
_mail24_8.9 in fact, in looks like unknown attributes are pruned out, which shouldn't happen (unknown elements are kept, albeit mess up with, see below)

_mail25_1.1 First define disability. 
_mail25_1.2 Someone can be disAbled by a congenital defect, chronic illnesses or injury. 
_mail25_1.3 It could be any combination of, or even multiple, congenital defects, illnesses and/or injuries. 
_mail25_1.4 There are also debilitating side effects of medications. 
_mail25_1.5 A &quot;nonreader&quot; is not necessarily blind 
_mail25_1.6  they may have had a TBI (traumatic brain injury) or have a Learning Disability. 
_mail25_1.7 Disabilities can effect fine and gross motor skills. 
_mail25_1.8 (Arthritis is a common fine motor complaint) 
_mail25_1.9 A Quadriplegic may use different assistive technologies, such as voice pilots, mouth tools or devices that follow eye movement. 
_mail25_1.10 Some people type with their toes! 
_mail25_1.11 IMO, before you can define Accessibility you must first define disability. 
_mail25_1.12 KPR, 
_mail25_1.13 LK
_mail25_2.2 Why? 
_mail25_2.3 I view that anyone should be able to access information, regardless of whether or not they have a &quot;disability.&quot; 
_mail25_2.4 Your access shouldn't be _limited_ because you have a certain quality about you that other people don't have. 
_mail25_2.5 Regardless if we call that a &quot;disability&quot; or not, it should not interfere with your ability to access content on the Internet. 
_mail25_2.6 I think it's perfectly reasonable to define &quot;accessibility&quot; with having a strict definition of &quot;disability&quot; as long as your accessibility definition doesn't speak _only_ about access for people who fit that disability definition.

_mail25_3.3 OK. 
_mail25_3.4 Here's my short definition: 
_mail25_3.5 &quot;Disability is a design flaw in the environment.&quot; 
_mail25_3.6 Here's the long version, from a chapter in an upcoming book on webbased training: 
_mail25_3.7 &quot;People are not &quot;disabled.&quot; 
_mail25_3.8 A disability is a consequence of design flaws in the environment. 
_mail25_3.9 Some individuals, due to accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing  or cannot perform  certain tasks, such as moving their legs, seeing, hearing, talking, grasping or lifting. 
_mail25_3.10 When these functional limitations are severe enough to adversely affect a person's performance, and the natural and human environments fail to accommodate their functional limitations, the individual is said to have a disability.&quot; 
_mail25_3.11 You take your pick. 
_mail25_3.12 If I were rewriting it, I would say something like this: 
_mail25_3.13 ... ALL individuals, due to circumstance, accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing  or cannot perform  certain tasks...

_mail25_4.4 I like to tell people that if a blind person can't access the web page she's trying to use, the REASON is not _her_ disability, but the disability of the _web author_ who created the page. 
_mail25_4.5 That web author is &quot;disabled&quot; because he was _not able_ to make a correct web page. 
_mail25_4.6 Why should she suffer for _his_ problem or failing? 
_mail25_4.7 In no way is a user with a disability &quot;disabled&quot; on the web 
_mail25_4.8  the sites THEMSELVES have the disability inherent in their code by not being accessible! 
_mail25_4.9 We should identify the problem where it exists. 
_mail25_4.10 The problem is not that there's anything &quot;wrong with&quot; the user, it is a problem with the page author and his output!

_mail27_1.1 Hi, 
_mail27_1.2 So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes.

_mail27_2.1 All, 
_mail27_2.2 has anyone heard of www.esight.org? 
_mail27_2.3 I looked at their site is it accessible? 
_mail27_2.4 I don t know much about cold fusion sites so I can t tell. 
_mail27_2.5 Sincerely, 
_mail27_2.6 Mike Burks
_mail27_3.1 All I get are the &quot;notify&quot; and &quot;beta tester&quot; links, which lead to forms to fill in the needed information. 
_mail27_3.2 (These work as they should.) 
_mail27_3.3 No word on what the site will actually do. 
_mail27_3.4 Sounds like a lot of Ehype to me.

_mail27_5.1 I don't get any unusual code (other than the CFM declaration at the top). 
_mail27_5.2 Otherwise it looks pretty normal, &amp;amp; reads just fine with JFW3.5. 
_mail27_5.3 A few small problems such as ALT text &quot;pages\cleardot1.gif&quot; (approx.), but nothing really unusual.

_mail27 Hi, So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes. One person didn't like the screen reader version because of the long links. What he didn't realize was that the links were the same for both versions. He just hadn't run into them in the standard version before trying the version for screen reader users. Two other users forgot to make a choice. The remaining 21 users preferred the version formatted for screen readers over the standard version.

_mail29_1.1 I have built a form which has a submit button on it. 
_mail29_1.2 If the user activates the button and hasn't filled out the form correctly, a javascript 'alert' popup is presented to the user, giving more information. 
_mail29_1.3 This appears to be in breach of checkpoint 10.1 
_mail29_1.5 Would it be acceptable to provide a warning message, something like 'Submitting this form may result in a popup dialog being displayed' before the submit button, in the same color as the background? 
_mail29_1.6 Thus (I believe) making the text available to screen reader users but not to sighted users?

_mail29_4.1 Hi All, 
_mail29_4.2 You could try using a spacer image and then put your message in the alt text. 
_mail29_4.3 I don't know how that will behave in the screenreader but it may help get around the problem with the search engine. 
_mail29_4.4 Anthony 
_mail29_5.4 Perhaps not, since putting spiderbait in alt attributes is just as old a searchengine as hiding stuff using colour. 
_mail29_5.5 On the other hand there isn't really anyway I can think of for spiders to know whether they are being baited unless there is a lot of repetition of words other than &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, etc. 
_mail29_5.6 Spiderbaiting in itself is quite a problem for users of text, whether sighted textonly users or users of enabling technologies. 
_mail29_5.7 I've quite often come across sites with little for a textonly user to read but the keywords they want to be listed over repeated 50 times.

_mail31_1.1 Peepo has advocated for some years the use of the keyboard as means to select links. 
_mail31_1.2 In the latest mozilla browser, when you type a letter, except in a text entry box, it cycles through links that have that letter in their text. 
_mail31_1.3 it seems slightly buggy, but what do you think?

_mail31_2.4 i found out about this only a few days ago and have been using the socalled 'typeaheadfind' since then quite a lot. 
_mail31_2.5 i haven't found it buggy at all and absolutely love it. 
_mail31_2.6 it's more a Find function then a 'cycling through links' function. 
_mail31_2.7 with the focus on the page you just type a word (or beginning of it) and mozilla jumps to that word. 
_mail31_2.8 F3 finds the next instance. 
_mail31_2.9 it first only looks at links but if you type a '/' (slash) before the word it searches the whole text. 
_mail31_2.10 it really just saves you bringing up that cumbersome Find dialogue box. 
_mail31_2.11 i don't think it really works for cycling through links. 
_mail31_2.12 the tab key works better for that.

_mail31_4.4 I have loved Opera's &quot;inline find&quot; for a long time. 
_mail31_4.5 Sounds like Moz has copped another Opera feature ;) 
_mail31_4.9 I still haven't found anything that matches Opera's CONTROL+J (which will list all links on the page).

_mail31_5.1 well those are some of the positives, how about disabling for those who are hyperactive, and just cannot stop fiddling with the keyboard? 
_mail31_5.2 its buggy in the sense that for instance 'k' words aren't just those that start with the letter k but also those that include the letter k.

_mail32_3.4 Yes, please, an update to the list of the data would be beneficial to us who do not maintain the same browsers or have the same capabilities as those who coded that very, very interesting albeit ironic poll.

_mail32_4.2 Sorry, the page was designed by a person with idea on usability. 
_mail32_4.3 A perennial portal problem...

_mail32_6.3 The poll did not display for me either, as you need scripting enabled to view it.

_mail32_7.2 Web Site Accessibility  
_mail32_7.3 Is your Web site accessible to the disabled?  
_mail32_7.4 percent  
_mail32_7.5 1.) Yes 22%  
_mail32_7.6 2.) No  but it will be within the next 12 months 15%  
_mail32_7.7 3.) No  and I can't see the point of doing so 16%  
_mail32_7.8 4.) No  it would be too difficult to do 6%  
_mail32_7.9 5.) Not sure  How do I do it? 41%
_mail32_8.6 Wonder how many of those have actually checked it, and aren't guessing 
_mail32_8.7 (it might have been swayed by it being posted here, though)? :)

_mail32_11.1 And that person is still waiting to hear from the Webmaster.  
_mail32_11.2 I would also like to apologise for not posting the final results but Internet problems prevented me from accessing the site... 
_mail32_11.3 that was my end of things and not the site that was having problems. 
_mail32_11.4 I will email again today and see if I can get an answer for the list.  
_mail32_11.5 Further apologies for those who could not access the poll, but I think that this is often typical of sites that run articles or polls on accessibility, and a complaint has been logged with the site.

_mail32 Dear All,  I found this interesting Website accessibility poll on: http://www.iwks.com/default.asp  Apologies now in case this page is not accessible  it's just that the results are very interesting and I would be happy to send an update to the list later on with the final results so we can all benefit from it.

Yes, please, an update to the list of the data would be beneficial to us who do not maintain the same browsers or have the same capabilities as those who coded that very, very interesting albeit ironic poll.   Tina Holmboe Greytower Technologies  tina@greytower.net http://www.greytower.net/  [+46] 0708 557 905The poll is halfway down on the right hand side of the page. Sorry, the page was designed by a person with idea on usability. A perennial portal problem...  The poll is just visible without scrolling down, underneath the Internet Works magazine image.  Are you viewing in graphics browser? Does anyone need better directions?  _____________________________________________________________________  VirusChecked by the Incepta Group plc  _____________________________________________________________________So far, the poll results say that 47% of the participants have no idea how to even make their site accessible, or what it means. That's just wonderful news.  RandalThe poll did not display for me either, as you need scripting enabled to view it. That's rather ironic considering the question.  Tom Gilder  Answers have gotten better.  Web Site Accessibility  Is your Web site accessible to the disabled?  percent  1.) Yes 22%  2.) No  but it will be within the next 12 months 15%  3.) No  and I can't see the point of doing so 16%  4.) No  it would be too difficult to do 6%  5.) Not sure  How do I do it? 41%Wonder how many of those have actually checked it, and aren't guessing (it might have been swayed by it being posted here, though)? :)  Tom Gilder  is there any way to find out how many people have voted?  Somebody on the list emailed the website yesterday to find out. Maybe if the site responds, he'll forward the answer to the list.

_mail36_1.1 Hi 
_mail36_1.2 I am just wondering if many users, disabilities or not, find white text on black background much easier to read than black on white.

_mail36_2.1 Jesper, 
_mail36_2.2 It is my experience that many visually impaired users who still retain some eyesight prefer light text on dark backgrounds, especially when on a monitor screen. 
_mail36_2.3 This is due in part to the fact that the &quot;glare&quot; from a white monitor screen is hard on the eyes, and can often wash out thin black lines (like text). 
_mail36_2.4 I personally know of at least 2 partially sighted users who have set up their machines with dark backgrounds and light text, even to the point of one setting their web browser to override developers colours. 
_mail36_2.5 JF

_mail36_4.6 I am aware that some people also swop between different settings, ie they may choose to work with black text on a white background in the morning, then as their eyes tire they might change their preferences to white text on a black background. 
_mail36_4.7 Also, when implementing the style switcher it is important not to prevent people from using their own style sheet or browser preferences.

_mail36_6.2 My understanding is that the original reason for using white (or green or orange) on black was that flicker is more obvious on large areas of solid white. 
_mail36_6.3 Viewing GUIs on CRTs, I get the impression that some rasterisers on some fonts don't handle white on black well (you need to handle them differently because a white pixel is larger than a black pixel, to ensure that adjacent white pixels overlap, when using a write white device, like a typical CRT.

Matthew Smith IT Consultant  KBC, South Australia KBC Web Site http://www.kbc.net.au PGP Public Key http://gpg.mss.cxMy understanding is that the original reason for using white (or green or orange) on black was that flicker is more obvious on large areas of solid white. Viewing GUIs on CRTs, I get the impression that some rasterisers on some fonts don't handle white on black well (you need to handle them differently because a white pixel is larger than a black pixel, to ensure that adjacent white pixels overlap, when using a write white device, like a typical CRT.
_mail37_1.1 BlankIt a appears another interesting case goes to court today where a wheel chair user is seeking compensation from London Stanstead Airport and Ryan Air for charging ?18.00 for the use of a wheelchair and lift to get onto the plane.  
_mail37_1.2 I realise it is the Airlines that take the flak for this, but I believe it is the Airport authority that makes the charge??  
_mail37_1.3 I think he has an open and shut case, but the outcome will be interesting, and I believe the airline and airport are only contesting the case as this sets a precedent to supply a reasonable service for all disabled travellers, world wide.  
_mail37_1.4 Shame on them
_mail37_2.2 When I worked for a tourism dotcom some years ago we weren't shy about suggesting that customers sue over this (it wasn't our company policy to do so, but individually we were outraged and didn't hide it).  
_mail37_2.4 IIRC the airlines are customers of the airport, not the passengers. 
_mail37_2.5 They charge the airlines for the use of the wheelchair lifts, I don't think any other airline passes the charge on the customer, whereas Ryan Air pass *everything* onto the customer.

_mail38_1.1 Many web authors make poor colour choices.  
_mail38_1.2 Some of these make pages unreadable to colourimpaired viewers. 
_mail38_1.3 Several browsers allow an override setting to be configured by the viewer. 
_mail38_1.4 DOES AMAYA ALLOW THE VIEWER TO OVERRIDE SETTING MADE INSIDE THE HTML DOCUMENTS  
_mail38_1.5 Being slightly blue/green impaired myself, I view this as an important accessibility feature that all browsers, including Amaya should include.

_mail38_2.5 Not exactly, but Amaya is an editor and you can easily change or remove the background/foreground color.

_mail38_3.1 John,  
_mail38_3.2 you could create your own local stylesheet, and make !imprtant declarations for colours.

_mail38_4.1 charles' 5 line CSS tutorial...  
_mail38_4.2 to give a style to an element you list the element (called a selector in technical CSS writing), then in curly brackets you put the style feature you want to declare, a colon, and the value you want for that property.  
_mail38_4.3 example:  
_mail38_4.4 BODY { fontsize: 24pt }  
_mail38_4.5 To set several properties at the same time, use a semicolon between each declaration, inside the same set of curly brackets.  
_mail38_4.6 example:  
_mail38_4.7 H1 { fontsize: 180% ; fontweight: bold ; lineheight: 1.5em }  
_mail38_4.8 To make your statements override the ones that an author uses, add !important after each property declaration  
_mail38_4.9 example:  
_mail38_4.10 P { fontsize: 12pt !important ; lineheight: 2em !important }  
_mail38_4.11 NOTE: You should not do this in stylesheets that you publish, only your local stylesheet for reading, until the CSS2 cascade order is widely implemented.  
_mail38_4.12 If your browser uses the CSS2 cascade order, this will be fine. 
_mail38_4.13 If not, then an author who has published a style sheet with !important will override yours. (sigh)  
_mail38_4.14 I don't know which cascade Amaya uses. 
_mail38_4.15 It does allow you to disable any style sheet attached to a document, which is a handy feature.
