Folks, 
please note that this meeting would be on at the same time as the ATIA meeting in Orlando, Florida. 
If the time is impossible for anyone please let us know as soon as possible 
 at the moment the next closest possible times are a week earlier (which will cut into the time available for last call review) or ten days later (which will possibly push our schedule back further). 
cheers

Dear working group participants, 
as discussed, the meeting will indeed be held on thursday 7 and friday 8 October. 
I am pleased to announce that Allaire Corp will be our hosts, and look forward to a productive two days, and some time to say hi. 
The nittygritty... 
Meeting registration is open from now until 1 October. 
register via the meeting page at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2foct99 which also provides details on location, accommodation, etc. 
There are a limited number of rooms available in the Royal Sonesta Hotel (which is the meeting venue) at a discounted rate 
 in order to qualify for this rate reservations and meeting registration must be completed by September 10. 
Since October is the peak season for Boston hotels, rooms are expensive and hotels book out early, so you are advised to make your plans and reservations as soon as possible. 
If you have any questions or special requirements please contact me as early as possible. 
Cheers

Most important  if you haven't registered yet, don't forget. 
http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU/f2foct99 for the details. 
Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people want to eat for lunch. 
The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille. 
Possible substitutions: 
baked Scrod (fish) 
chicken caesar salad 
hommus rollup sandwich with salad 
salad with crab cakes 
churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions 
I will do this in the following way: 
If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear. 
It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do. 
The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday. 
No response will not be considered a vote for the default 
 it will be considered a vote for &quot;whatever gets chosen&quot; 
Sorry to bore you with administrivia, but I figure that having food that people like helps the meeting go well... 
cheers
