Hi, 
So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes. 
One person didn't like the screen reader version because of the long links. 
What he didn't realize was that the links were the same for both versions. 
He just hadn't run into them in the standard version before trying the version for screen reader users. 
Two other users forgot to make a choice. 
The remaining 21 users preferred the version formatted for screen readers over the standard version. 
A couple of people commented that they would want some more text on the screen reader version.

All, 
has anyone heard of www.esight.org? 
I looked at their site is it accessible? 
I don t know much about cold fusion sites so I can t tell.

All I get are the &quot;notify&quot; and &quot;beta tester&quot; links, which lead to forms to fill in the needed information. 
(These work as they should.) 
No word on what the site will actually do. 
Sounds like a lot of Ehype to me.

I don't get any unusual code (other than the CFM declaration at the top). 
Otherwise it looks pretty normal, &amp;amp; reads just fine with JFW3.5. 
A few small problems such as ALT text &quot;pages\cleardot1.gif&quot; (approx.), but nothing really unusual. 
Unless there is some CFMgenerated applet thing happening that I'm missing completely.
