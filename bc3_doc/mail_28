WL: I wish I could understand the notion of making reading more possible within an environment that wasn't "textheavy". 
Perhaps it would be "nice" for people for whom text is a problem but just how is it "possible".  
In at least the commonest definition of the word "read", the matter that one reads is "text". 
I understand the part about "communication" not requiring a "textheavy" environment, but not "reading". 
Love.  
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT  NOT PRIVILEGE
> In at least the commonest definition of the word "read", the matter that one reads is "text".  
This isn't necessarily the case, William. 
There is a lot of reading that is nontextual.  
I _highly_ recommend, to everyone on this list, the book "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud. 
It deals with the (U.S.) comic book medium and has some interesting thoughts and concepts on the "language of comics" as a blend between graphical and text media.  
In fact, I have it on the shelf behind me at work as I type this, beside my XHTML, XSLT, CSS, usability, and disability references.

 I was wondering if you would explain your work in this area. 
I am currently doing an MSc in Computer Studies and my project is looking at web accessibility for people with learning disabilities. 
I'd appreciate any useful ideas/references that you or anyone else reading this may have.  
Thanks!

Is this bookshelf documented on Kynn.COM, or would you consider sharing with us a short list of the references you find the most helpful?

Hey, that's not a bad idea. 
In fact, I encourage everyone else to share their favorite bookshelf collections 
 if relevant to WAI activities. 
I'll post mine on kynn.com tomorrow when I'm back in the office.
