Could anyone give me a lead as far as a website to visit or a federal department to talk to about the accessbility of Federal Credit Union websites? 
Does 508 apply to the Federal Credit Unions? 
Is this written down anywhere? 
Thanks,

http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/money/creditunions/fedcredt.htm describes what the Credit Unions are. 
I would doubt that these organizations, owned by their members, are covered by 508.

&gt; Federal Credit Unions are not federal agencies, they are owned by the members that form them. 
&gt; They are regulated, however. 
&gt; See http://www.cuna.org/data/consumer/whatis/whatisacu.html and (when it's up) http://www.ncua.gov/ 
&gt; As far as I can see, a credit union doesn't fall under 508.

But they DO fall under ADA and that does require &quot;equivalent facilitation&quot; which could require usable web site and Section 508 serves as guidance
