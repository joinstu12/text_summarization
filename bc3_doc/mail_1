hi all,  
As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups. 
I wrote to the wwwrdfinterest list asking for data:  
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wwwrdfinterest/2003Apr/0252.html  
so we'll have to see how that pans out. 
Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples).  
There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples:  
http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/geo/intro.html#demos  
So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on. 
We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require. 
At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like:  
http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/brand%20x/maps%20and%20globes/t_bxp_c31027.jpg.jpg  
which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours);  
and http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg  
which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though).  
Do people have a preference for one style over the other?  
Could you let us know today if possible? 
We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003.  
thanks,  
Libby  
p.s. Here's a nice similar idea:

Can't say I'm particularly grabbed by either of them, but if you have to pick one I'd go for the map, not the globe. 
Is there any reason it has to be geographically accurate? 
Perhaps a schematic, analogous to the London Underground map of London, would allow you to convey the sense of spatial distribution without getting hung up on the scale problem. 
Of course, you may not consider that a helpful suggestion given the short timescale :)  
Cheers,  
Ian

One advantage of being geographically accurate is it simplifies our lives when we try to plot SW researchers, groups, events etc on the map...  
I prefer the map to the globe, fwiw.  
Dan
yeah, sorry it's such a rush. 
It took a long time to write the document explaining how to write the RDF. 
At this stage we really need examples to show the designer though 
 I'll pass your comments along to him, see if he has anything like that.  
What don't you like about them in particular?  
thanks for the feedback

Hi Libby,  
> What don't you like about them in particular?  
The globe is too visually busy for a background (imho), and if you decrease the opacity I think you'll lose too much of the important bits (like where the UK is :). 
The map would be OK as a backdrop for the FOAF map if it was semiopaque, but (a) it misses out the rest of the world, as you said yourself, and (b) there's a big blue empty space on the left :). 
The atlantic is just too big** if you keep it to scale, hence my suggestion to use more of a schematic approach. 
I guess you need the cartographical equivalent of an ellipsis, whatever that might be!  
Cheers,  
Ian

thanks Ian. 
I broadly agree with you. 
For (b) though, that might work in our favour, as we can put a logo and/or a slogan there.
