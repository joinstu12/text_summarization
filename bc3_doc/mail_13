We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html. 
ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them. 
I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th). 
Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings. 
This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th. 
Monday is Martin Luther King day. 
What are your thoughts? 
Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor? 
I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it. 
Thanks for your input.

I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ??? 
MLK Day is never better than in Savannah! 
maybe we could go there? 
I personally don't want to spend my life in Orlando, thank you! 
I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home. 
I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints.

Any time or venue should be fine with me. 
Thanks, Tim Boland NIST

I have never had a holiday in Venice, although I would like to. 
But I can confirm that it is a nice place to have a meeting, and could probably attend (it is not that hard to get to from Europe). 
cheers

Voglio andare a venezia! 
oops 
 one should not show such enthusiasm, I suspect! 
Could we be careful to make the dates so that those of us who do come a long way can make it, please! 
Liddy
If we can plan, what about planning the year, Australia included? 
best time for us is anytime 
 maybe northern winter from others' perspectives? 
Liddy
Planning meetings a year in advance (at least tentatively) is a good idea. 
I will add this to the agenda for the next call.
