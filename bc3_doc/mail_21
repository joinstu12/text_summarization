Quick question. 
In earlier versions of Acrobat, it was not possible to make PDF files accessible if the files were actually developed on a Macintosh.  
Is this still the case with the latest version of Acrobat for the Mac (version 6.0, I believe)?  
Thanks for any information.

Doyle,  
The Make Accessible command is now available in Acrobat Pro 6.0 for the Mac as well as for Windows.

Hello Loretta/Doyle,  
I am just not sure what the Make Accessible feature really does. 
I am a JAWS user and a PDF file is as usable or unusable as it was before I run the Make Accessible feature on it. 
I'll be glad if you can enlighten me on this.

Sailesh,  
Make Accessible is a command that attempts to analyze an untagged PDF file and infer logical structure from the marks on the page. 
This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file. 
The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure. 
Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author.  
In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows. 
In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows.  
When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure. 
This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF.
