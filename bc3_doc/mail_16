Just a reminder: 
we are holding a conference call today in spite of the fact that it is a holiday (Thanksgiving) in the US. 
I don't know if any of our editors will be on the call, so I suggest we use the time to discuss Wendy's draft charter. 
It can be found at: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/newcharter2000.html  
Attendance at today's meeting is optional for our American colleagues. 
If you have to choose between turkey and talking, I will understand if you opt for the food.

at least i can type with my mouth full !!!  
by the way, does anyone have any comments or suggestions on the Case Study we submitted on how to make Macromedia accessible? 
Would like to modify the 50 State Quarter Interactive Map at www1.usmint.gov. 
We are also making more of these for other products and one is in development now.

could you please be sure to always include the telephone number and times in these communications please.  
I have great difficulty in being available due to teaching duties.

aloha!  
in addition to including the phone number and time of the call in meeting announcements, could you please email the reminders the day _BEFORE_ the meeting, as it does me little good if i receive a reminder for a meeting shortly before the meeting begins, especially if that is a day where i could spare an hour or so for a telecon, but don't want to get sucked into answering all of my accumulated email!

I beleive WAI and assume W3C policy is that meeting announcements, including an agenda should be posted to the list at least 24 hours prior to a telecon meeting. 
I have tried to adhere to this policy in the UA working group and I think it has help keep people interested in the participating in the telecons.
