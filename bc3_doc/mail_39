Chris Lilley, Brian Stell and others have been discussing the rash of irate, &quot;get me off this list&quot; mesages the listserv has received, lately. 
Well, folks: YOU CAN'T UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THIS LIST! 
I've tried for 2 months to get off this list, I've followed the rules, I've tried variations of the theme, looking for some hidden codeall to no avail. 
So, the last resort of those who have tried everything else is to post to the list they want to be rid of. 
It's irony, but it's a fact. 
PLEASE GET ME OFF THIS LIST@!%$#$/\%

I've been trying for awhile too, and I can't seem to get off. 
Please! 
Take me off this list!

&gt; Well, that explains a lot! I've been trying for awhile too, and I can't

&gt; Please! Take me off this list! And *fix* your subscribe/unsubscribe 
&gt; automated email list!! 
Please remain calm. 
Our automated list manager works very well. 
Sometimes there are problems due to: 
 you being subscribed under another name/address  
this was the case for the first among the two recent messages. 
 you being subscribed to a mail exploder in the company you work for  
this, I believe, was the case for the second person. 
Please talk to your sysadm about this problem  
there is nothing we can do 
Regards,

Well, after receiving a message that informed me of this, I responded with an unsubscribe email with my unaliased email address, and today received an automated response informing me that your software could not find my name on your list. 
I am very calm. 
I simply want off this list.

&gt; It is possible that you are on another mailing list that is sending you the wwwfont messages. 
&gt; If you're on an internal mailing list where you work, for instance, and someone subscribed that list to the wwwfont list, you may be getting it indirectly, in which case unsubscribing yourself will not get you off the list.
Thanks for the helpful info, but I just received a message saying that I have been removed from the list. 
Why? 
Because I posted my difficulties to the list. 
Sorry I had to burden you all with my problems, but as you can see, it worked.
