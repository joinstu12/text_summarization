The BC3 Annotation Framework
	
This framework allows researchers to annotate emails or other conversations by using an online annotations tool. This allows for easy email corpus management and annotation export. There is no need for time consuming data entry as all the annotation is done through a web browser.
The software is written in Ruby on Rails and runs as a webserver using a database such as MySQL.
	
Installation Steps:

1. Install Ruby on Rails and it's dependencies: http://rubyonrails.org
2. Install a database such as MySQL http://www.mysql.com
3. Change the config/database.yml file as follows:
	development:
  		adapter: mysql
  		database: userstudy_development
  		username: <Your mysql username>
  		password: <Your mysql password>
4. Create and set up the database
		rake db:create
		rake db:migrate
5. Start the WEBrick server
		script/server
6. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3000 with Firefox
		Note: this has only been tested with Firefox (other browsers might have compatibility issues)
		
		
Using the software:
	The menu at the top is used to navigate the different functions of the framework.
	The Emails tag is used to upload and manage emails or conversations.
	The Threads tag is used to manage the different email threads.
	The Experiments tag is used to start and run annotations.
	The Participants tag is used to see your annotators info.
	The Add Admin tag is used to create other accounts for researchers.
	Use the Log Out tag to leave the interface.
	
Design of the Software:
	Ruby on Rails uses a MVC approach to separate the different functions of the website. I will describe the project architecture by showing the model names and the fields the each contain.
