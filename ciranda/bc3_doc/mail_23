I recently discovered that ABC Radio National here in Australia (http://www.abc.net.au/rn/) offers transcripts of certain of its programmes via the web. 
I haven't checked the accessibility of the site, and, as I understand it, the transcripts appear several days after the programmes themselves have been broadcast. 
Are other radio stations with a presence on the web adopting similar policies?
more interestingly check out http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS 
As far as I can tell, it's not linked into their main page yet. 
Note that the page is extremely table rich (a euphasism of sorts) 
but emacspeak/w3 should give you good access.

Public Radio International &amp;lt;http://www.pri.org/&amp;gt; offers RealAudio transcripts of at least some of their shows.

The central point here is that providing transcripts of audio content is a requirement under the guidelines, so that if an audio stream is provided, transcripts must also be made available.
All, 
where is the best place to find our specifics about the issues involved with web pages and color blindness? 
Does anyone know?

We have three links listed on the AWARE Center site, on the &quot;tips&quot; page: 
http://aware.hwg.org/tips/ 
But I would love to have more. 
Diane Wilson's site (linked from the page above) is a nice start:
