Peter, 
to clear up a possible confusion, can you confirm that you're use of SLD refers to specific learning difficulty or dyslexia, and not Severe Learning Difficulties or cognitive disability? 
looks to be a great resource, we now link to it and http://www.techdis.ac.uk/seven/disability_and_the_web.html from http://www.learningdifferently.com/develop/papers.html where there are links to many other useful resources on LDD and the web 
thanks

hi, 
The paper cover Dyslexia and Dyslexiclike specific learning difficulties. 
But it does it does not specifically cover the &quot;learning disabled&quot;, &quot;Severe Learning Difficulties&quot; or Cognitive disabilities. 
My remit is for those who could be potentially studying at a minimum of a Further Educational level. 
You might find that the paper covers many of the issues but it completely sidesteps the issues when a student has a savere language difficulty or savere cognition problem... 
I would need to go into talking about the appropriateness of content, symbolic communications. etc etc. 
I do hope within the future to write a similar paper about web accessibility for those with hearing impairment (including prelingually deaf).
