Many web authors make poor colour choices.  
Some of these make pages unreadable to colourimpaired viewers. 
Several browsers allow an override setting to be configured by the viewer. 
DOES AMAYA ALLOW THE VIEWER TO OVERRIDE SETTING MADE INSIDE THE HTML DOCUMENTS  
Being slightly blue/green impaired myself, I view this as an important accessibility feature that all browsers, including Amaya should include.

Not exactly, but Amaya is an editor and you can easily change or remove the background/foreground color.

John,  
you could create your own local stylesheet, and make !imprtant declarations for colours.

charles' 5 line CSS tutorial...  
to give a style to an element you list the element (called a selector in technical CSS writing), then in curly brackets you put the style feature you want to declare, a colon, and the value you want for that property.  
example:  
BODY { fontsize: 24pt }  
To set several properties at the same time, use a semicolon between each declaration, inside the same set of curly brackets.  
example:  
H1 { fontsize: 180% ; fontweight: bold ; lineheight: 1.5em }  
To make your statements override the ones that an author uses, add !important after each property declaration  
example:  
P { fontsize: 12pt !important ; lineheight: 2em !important }  
NOTE: You should not do this in stylesheets that you publish, only your local stylesheet for reading, until the CSS2 cascade order is widely implemented.  
If your browser uses the CSS2 cascade order, this will be fine. 
If not, then an author who has published a style sheet with !important will override yours. (sigh)  
I don't know which cascade Amaya uses. 
It does allow you to disable any style sheet attached to a document, which is a handy feature.  
Cheers

I have used a stylesheet which works ok on my own editing at at my own site and on those where people are kind enough to let one choose for themself. 
Unfortunately once someone's site chooses a color you are stuck with it... 
I am suggesting that an override be provided as an ACCESSIBILITY issue. 
Amaya can lead the way on this as it does on several other issues such as MathML. 
Thanks for suggestion. 
It took a while to get amaya.css going as at first i thought it had to have tags ala html 
 this worked on other browsers but not in amaya 
 dropped any html tags and it worked like charm. 
I had better buy a better reference 
 one by que fails....

Amaya doesn't take !important flag into account yet
