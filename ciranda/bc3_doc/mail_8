It is probable that we can arrange a telephone connection, to call in via a US bridge. 
Are there people who are unable to make the face to face meeting, but would like us to have this facility? 
Please respond as soon as possible 
 the decision will be made early next week. 
cheers

At least one &quot;people&quot; would. 
Love. 
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT  NOT PRIVILEGE
And at least on &quot;people&quot; would like you te be present 
 even at the end of a phone line (though in person would be better, of course!)

Add Phil Jenkins to the list of &quot;on the phone&quot; 
I will not be in the office, so an 800 number would be best.

Since it will be Mountain time where I'll be, 9am  5pm Amsterdam time is 1am  9am, so I would participate the second half of the day. 
Is there a good time to call in after Amsterdam lunch?
