Dear All,  
I found this interesting Website accessibility poll on: http://www.iwks.com/default.asp  
Apologies now in case this page is not accessible 
 it's just that the results are very interesting and I would be happy to send an update to the list later on with the final results so we can all benefit from it.  
Kind regards  
Simon

It was indeed interesting 
 I can't get at the results either with Opera or Lynx.  
Yes, please, an update to the list of the data would be beneficial to us who do not maintain the same browsers or have the same capabilities as those who coded that very, very interesting albeit ironic poll.

The poll is halfway down on the right hand side of the page. 
Sorry, the page was designed by a person with idea on usability. 
A perennial portal problem...  
The poll is just visible without scrolling down, underneath the Internet Works magazine image.  
Are you viewing in graphics browser? 
Does anyone need better directions?

So far, the poll results say that 47% of the participants have no idea how to even make their site accessible, or what it means. 
That's just wonderful news.

The poll did not display for me either, as you need scripting enabled to view it. 
That's rather ironic considering the question.

Wonder how many of those have actually checked it, and aren't guessing 
(it might have been swayed by it being posted here, though)? :)

is there any way to find out how many people have voted?

Somebody on the list emailed the website yesterday to find out. 
Maybe if the site responds, he'll forward the answer to the list.

And that person is still waiting to hear from the Webmaster.  
I would also like to apologise for not posting the final results but Internet problems prevented me from accessing the site... 
that was my end of things and not the site that was having problems. 
I will email again today and see if I can get an answer for the list.  
Further apologies for those who could not access the poll, but I think that this is often typical of sites that run articles or polls on accessibility, and a complaint has been logged with the site.  
Kind regards  
Simon
