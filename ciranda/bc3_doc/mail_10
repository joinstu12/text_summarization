There have been a couple of possiblities raised:  
Ottawa, 5 or 6 October (This depends on a number of other W3C timing issues)  
Nashville, mid october  
How do people feel about either of these? 
Are we ready for a meeting, overdue for one, nowhere near it? 
Are these good locations, or does someone have another proposal (offer of hosting...)

I think we should have something more concrete to meet about 
 something that doesn't lend itself to list/telecon handling.  
Plus it would be extremely helpful if more than one WG met around the same time/place. 
Not necessarily in conjunction with some "external" event.  
Love.  
ACCESSIBILITY IS RIGHT  NOT PRIVILEGE

I think a facetoface is a good idea and have no problems with either of the dates suggested.

The Nashville conference is the Educause conference from October 1013. 
All courseware developers will be attending. 
Norman Coombs and I will be presenting on accessible courseware authoring. 
Information about the event is at: http://www.educause.edu/conference/e2000  
For the face to face meeting we had talked about having a working meeting. 
We would have a set of tasks ie. Techniques for specific checkpoints, designing the conformance document, evaluating representative tools. 
We would break out into small groups to create drafts and then gather as a whole group to review the drafts.
