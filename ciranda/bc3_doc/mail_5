I propose to cancel this weeks telecon and schedule another for 12 Mar 2004, if needed. 
I would like to get moving on comments on the TAG architecture document. 
Jan  are you still up for reviewing? 
Can we aim to get other comments in by the end of this week and agreement by email next week?

I think that means we will not formally respond to I18N on the charmod comments, shall I tell them that we do not intend to, but that the email discussion has not shown any disagreement. 
e.g. I have informed the RDF Core WG of your decisions, and no one has indicated unhappiness 
 however we have not formally discussed these issues; 
and are not likely to.

Ah. 
Is this a problem. 
Have I understood correctly they are going through last call again anyway.

When is the deadline? 
I'm prepared to decide by email so we can formally respond by email.

&gt; I propose to cancel this weeks telecon 
Im assuming that they are all cancelled unless I hear otherwise. 
Maybe that should be our default?

I still plan to write a rather long diatribe on this if I can find the time. 
I doubt if the rest of the WG will endorse all of it but I will send it along asap, hopefully some time next week.

Likewise, whether or not anyone else in the WG agrees with any of my own personal comments, c.f. http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/wwwarchive/2004Feb/0003.html

&gt; Ah.

Yes  
I could change my draft informal response to indicate that if we have any other formal response it will be included in our LC review comments on their new documents. 
&gt;&gt; e.g. 
&gt;&gt; I have informed the RDF Core WG of your decisions, and no one has indicated unhappiness 
&gt;&gt;  however we have not formally discussed these issues; 
&gt;&gt; and are not likely to. 
&gt; When is the deadline? 
&gt; I'm prepared to decide by email so we can formally respond by email. 
Two weeks from when I received the message .... 
i.e. during Cannes 
 I suspect that is also the real deadline, in that I imagine they want to make their final decisions at Cannes 
I am happy to draft a formal response that is pretty vacuous, for email vote.

That is a reasonable working assumption. 
I've been announcing telecon's in advance and cancelling if not needed to keep within w3c process.

Please do.
