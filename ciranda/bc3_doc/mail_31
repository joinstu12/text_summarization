Peepo has advocated for some years the use of the keyboard as means to select links. 
In the latest mozilla browser, when you type a letter, except in a text entry box, it cycles through links that have that letter in their text. 
it seems slightly buggy, but what do you think? 
(course it screws my coding right and proper) 
thanks

i found out about this only a few days ago and have been using the socalled 'typeaheadfind' since then quite a lot. 
i haven't found it buggy at all and absolutely love it. 
it's more a Find function then a 'cycling through links' function. 
with the focus on the page you just type a word (or beginning of it) and mozilla jumps to that word. 
F3 finds the next instance. 
it first only looks at links but if you type a '/' (slash) before the word it searches the whole text. 
it really just saves you bringing up that cumbersome Find dialogue box. 
i don't think it really works for cycling through links. 
the tab key works better for that.

Indeed.... 
I have loved Opera's &quot;inline find&quot; for a long time. 
Sounds like Moz has copped another Opera feature ;)

I still haven't found anything that matches Opera's CONTROL+J (which will list all links on the page). 
It also gives you a quick method to see if your links will make sense when read out of context.

well those are some of the positives, how about disabling for those who are hyperactive, and just cannot stop fiddling with the keyboard? 
its buggy in the sense that for instance 'k' words aren't just those that start with the letter k but also those that include the letter k. 
I'd expect it to have a few others besides.
