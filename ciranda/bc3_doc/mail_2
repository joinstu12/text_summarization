I am planning my schedule at CHI 2003 <http://www.chi2003.org/> 
 will there be anything happening at the conference related to this W3C User interest group?  
I do not see anything on the program yet, but I suspect we could at least have an informal SIG 
 a chance to meet others and bring someone like me (who missed the workshop) up to speed on what is happening.  
Like all CHIs, there will be many competing activities, so the sooner we can set this up the more likely I can attend.

I will be at CHI. 
I sent an email to Steven Pemberton about getting an update on his draft of the charter and its status at W3C. 
I really would like to get some updated info. before planning an informal SIG. 
However, if you email me that you are interested in meeting at CHI, I can try to arrange something  
either signing up for an informal sig or arranging to meet for lunch or something.

It's been quite a while since I've seen any traffic on this list serv. 
I had to check with Matt May to make sure things were still in synch on the working group.  
Let's not lose our zeal folks!

I think we decided at the NIST meetings to have our next meeting at CHI, and I have been planning on such a meeting there. 
Did this plan change?

I have been in contact with Steven Pemberton. 
Here is the plan for CHI:  
I will sign up for an informal SIG at CHI. 
I haven't found out the time slots yet, but will try to today. 
For those of you who want to attend the sig, let me know if you have any hard constraints and I will try to sign up for a time to accommodate as many people as possible. 
Steven and I will also meet at CHI for planning purposes.

The most convenient time to schedule the W3C UIG informal sig discussion is: Tuesday 4/8 12:30pm  
This is the lunchtime slot. 
I don't think we will need the entire 90 minutes so there will be time for lunch afterwards.  
As of Friday, this slot was still open for an informal SIG.  
If this is not available or there are conflicts, Wednesday 4/9 12:30 will be the backup.  
I will email the informal SIG people and get on the schedule this afternoon and confirm via this listserv.  
Hope to see you next week.

CHI attendees:
