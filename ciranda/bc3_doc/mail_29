I have built a form which has a submit button on it. 
If the user activates the button and hasn't filled out the form correctly, a javascript 'alert' popup is presented to the user, giving more information. 
This appears to be in breach of checkpoint 10.1 
http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/waipageauth.html#techavoidpopups 
Would it be acceptable to provide a warning message, something like 'Submitting this form may result in a popup dialog being displayed' before the submit button, in the same color as the background? 
Thus (I believe) making the text available to screen reader users but not to sighted users?

This will show up on any device that cannot display colours or doesn't understand the styling used to set the colours. 
It is a known trick for stuffing keywords for search engines and may result in the site being boycotted by major search engines. 
One is expecting a major change in content when one submits a form, so one of the main reasons for avoiding popups doesn't apply.
It also depends on how the screen reader gets its content  
readers that are too smart about colours (a useful feature) will realise that the text is invisible and skip it. 
(given the way this is normally used to stuff keywords in pages, it is not a bad practice).

Hi All, 
You could try using a spacer image and then put your message in the alt text. 
I don't know how that will behave in the screenreader but it may help get around the problem with the search engine.

Perhaps not, since putting spiderbait in alt attributes is just as old a searchengine as hiding stuff using colour. 
On the other hand there isn't really anyway I can think of for spiders to know whether they are being baited unless there is a lot of repetition of words other than &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, etc. 
Spiderbaiting in itself is quite a problem for users of text, whether sighted textonly users or users of enabling technologies. 
I've quite often come across sites with little for a textonly user to read but the keywords they want to be listed over repeated 50 times.
