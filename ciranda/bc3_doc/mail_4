Sorry, I thought we had until the end of the week. 
I can offer to hold the meeting here at Microsoft if the wg prefers Seattle at that time. 
Yes, the sun has been known to shine here in August :  ) 
Either location is OK with me btw.

Has the decision been made, or should I express my preference for Seattle? :)

There has been very little comment either way on this at the meeting or on the list. 
The problem is that W3C rules require 6 weeks notice of meetings which I believe applies to time and location. 
Assuming this is true, I think we have to go with the UC Irvine location unless we want to postpone the meeting....

Pesonally  If we are going to do "it" in Washington State, My vote is for Seattle rather than Redmond, unless we are are all camping at "Bill's new place on the lake" and you are making arrangements to have us shuttle in from SeaTac to the private Microsoft Airport. 
Staging in Seattle saves the bulk of us the drive out to Redmond.  
I myself would rather see us there staying at someplace like the Edgewater than in Redmond by far. 
It's really easier to get to and has more nightlife, etc etc etc. 
A number of us have personal experience of the Edgewater's facilities from one of last year's ISC Meetings we had there.  
Very good site and lots of reasoably priced facilities in the area and Pikes Market Arcade Area is a hop, skip, and a jump away.  
Otherwise, by my vote  Sourthern California is fine by me.

I think Don's post just closed the issue. 
It's in Irvine.
