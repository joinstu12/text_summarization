I have noticed that when using a screen reading browser such as IBM homepage reader when words are joined together for example &quot;homepage&quot; the words &quot;home&quot; and &quot;page&quot; are not recognised, as a consequence the joined words become incomprehensible to the screenreading software. 
I haven't found any references to this within the gudielines. 
have i missed them?
14.1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate... [priority 1] 
Of course at some point speech technology needs to learn how to deal with common but new terms in a language. 
Homepage is one that I would expect to work  especially in a product whose name includes the term. 
But Text to Speech is an inexact science  even people who are experts cannot agree to pronounce words the same way. 
Just ask a welltrained and very literate American chemist what the eleme whose symbol is Al is called  they tell you about a thing called &quot;aluminum&quot;. 
But they are in fact referring to what any Australian voice recogniser would expect to hear as al(y)amin(i)yum. 
The problem is funnier (after people get over the inconvenience of learning about it) when a screen reader uses a finnish or swedish synthesiser but provides its cues and prompts in english...

No, it's not obvious at all. 
Yes, when in doubt, hypenate compounds if you have any doubt as to how long they have been in the language. 
Some screen readers will successfully divide camelCase agglutinations. 
I don't know how widespread this is, though. 
You would have to have the memory of an elephant to pull up the following flames. 
But they do touch on texttospeech, along with lay persons, people operating in a second language, and others with reading difficulty as at risk on account of unusual words including neologisms:

The point is to have and apply a reasonably small word list and handle those things that fall outside this list as special. 
My spellchecker in Eudora 4 bounces 'homepage' and suggests &quot;home page&quot; as a possible correction. 
Need we say more? 
It could be as simple as &lt;acronym title=&quot;home page&quot;&gt; homepage &lt;/acronym&gt; although purists will yell at me.

There is probably a good argument for raising the issue of proper names. 
In my brief experience it seems that common dictionary words are read well enough. 
However it seems that people and place names are not. 
These are the very words that are of greatest interest. 
it would also be great to see a decent ua that offered alternative readings (as per spell checker example), a memorise function, and possibly the opportunity to share the choice with a public database. 
Perhaps somone knows of this? 
thanks
It would appear that this is readily available using Speech synthesis markup language and XSLT (or XSLT 2 perhaps)... 
or someone can make smarter and smarter speech synthessisers. 
If Audio CSS allowed something equivalent to SSML's sayas propoerty, we would be closer perhaps.

Sorry, you are missing the main brunt of Jonathan's remarks. 
Yes, SSML, modularized, provides the WCAG piece. 
But who/how accesses the dictionary? 
One of the creative things he raises is uploading your pronunciation repairs to the community. 
What Annotea would like to do. 
But personal data is in LDAP today, not RDF. 
So we need LDAP bindings for the SSML. 
To make the web whole.
