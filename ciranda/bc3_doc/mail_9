Peter, or other folks  
Is there anyone from the OpenOffice or StarOffice projects who has time to represent the group on the W3C Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines working group, or to give us updates and feedback on how much those guidelines are implemented by the project?  
The Guidelines are designed to apply to all tools used to produce content for the Web 
 both "HTML editors" and the range of other tools that people use to produce content, such as office productivity tools and media editing tools.  
More information at http://www.w3.org/WAI/AU and guidelines (W3C Recommendation since Feb 2000) at http://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG10  
cheers

We did hold a short meeting with Phil and Heather on the call. 
The Summit was discussed. 
Heather will not be able to make it due to wedding plans, IBM will be there. 
Everyone thought it was a good opportunity to pull together the various efforts.
