I am not sure this will hold but 
As a general rule.... 
I think we should try to design guidelines that do not forbid anything  but 
rather tell people how to do things so that they will be accessible. 
When the next version comes out next week  we should look through it to see 
how it looks in this regard.

I agree with this approach. Consistent with this approach, I feel, 
is a methodology of &quot;guiding&quot; which says &quot;well, you can do it, but 
to do it right you have to do (x), (y), and (z), and that will still 
mean you're losing out on (a), (b), and (c), but if you REALLY REALLY 
WANT TO, hey, it's your choice.&quot; 
This isn't forbidding anything  but it's making it clear that there 
are definite problems with certain approaches, and if someone chooses 
to follow that path, they at least will be aware of the consequences 
of their actions.

I think even WCAG 1.0 can be regarded as consistent with this method of 
specifying guidelines, in that the word &quot;avoid&quot; was deliberately chosen to 
imply the existence of alternative, more accessible, means of achieving 
the same objective. WCAG 2.0 should, however, make this point clearer, to 
avoid (pun intended) giving the impression that there are prohibitions in 
the guidelines that would limit the capacity of content creators to design 
web sites that fulfill their respective purposes.
Gregg, 
You make an excellent point! 
As soon as you &quot;forbid&quot; something, you find out that some disabled group 
at an opposite end of some spectrum &quot;needs&quot; what you've forbidden ... we 
need to explain the consequences, and let the author decide what is most 
appropriate for his/her site.

Excellent point  the body of knowledge for disability access 
considerations, beyond those of blind people (which are generally 
wellexplored these days), is pretty skimpy. We're still in the 
exploration/discovery process of &quot;what works&quot;, and as we see more 
solutions like Reef's  which allow you to build an interface for 
ONE audience without fearing interference with OTHER audiences' 
interfaces  we will encounter more and more solutions which will 
&quot;work&quot; for some people and &quot;not work&quot; for others. 
Forbidding them outright will cause a lot of problems, in the same 
way that alternate interfaces stated &quot;as a last resort&quot; cause problems 
when usable, accessible design is your &quot;first resort&quot;! 
Absolutes should be avoided, always.

Absolutely!
