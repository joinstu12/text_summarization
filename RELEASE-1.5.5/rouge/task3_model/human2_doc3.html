<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6>Public Radio International &amp;lt;http://www.pri.org/&amp;gt; offers RealAudio transcripts of at least some of their shows. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>The central point here is that providing transcripts of audio content is a requirement under the guidelines, so that if an audio stream is provided, transcripts must also be made available.</a>

<a name="9">[9]</a><a href="#9" id=9>We have three links listed on the AWARE Center site, on the &quot;tips&quot; page: </a>
