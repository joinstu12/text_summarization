<a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id=2>I am just wondering if many users, disabilities or not, find white text on black background much easier to read than black on white. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id=3>I have seen some switchers that do this and if the choices offered do not suit someone's needs it can be quite limiting. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a><a href="#4" id=4>&gt; I am just wondering if many users, disabilities or not, find white text on black background much easier to read than black on white. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>This is due in part to the fact that the &quot;glare&quot; from a white monitor screen is hard on the eyes, and can often wash out thin black lines (like text). </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6>I personally know of at least 2 partially sighted users who have set up their machines with dark backgrounds and light text, even to the point of one setting their web browser to override developers colours. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>It is my experience that many visually impaired users who still retain some eyesight prefer light text on dark backgrounds, especially when on a monitor screen. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a><a href="#8" id=8>Best regards, </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a><a href="#9" id=9>I am aware that some people also swop between different settings, ie they may choose to work with black text on a white background in the morning, then as their eyes tire they might change their preferences to white text on a black background. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a><a href="#10" id=10>Also, when implementing the style switcher it is important not to prevent people from using their own style sheet or browser preferences. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a><a href="#11" id=11>*If anyone has done any study on this, specifically with the RGB triplets used in CSS, would they like to share? </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a><a href="#12" id=12>Will you be including any other colour schemes? </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a><a href="#13" id=13>My understanding is that the original reason for using white (or green or orange) on black was that flicker is more obvious on large areas of solid white. </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a><a href="#14" id=14>&gt; I am just wondering if many users, disabilities or not, find white text on black background much easier to read than black on white. </a>
