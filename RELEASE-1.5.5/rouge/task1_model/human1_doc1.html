<a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id=2>They charge the airlines for the use of the wheelchair lifts, I don't think any other airline passes the charge on the customer, whereas Ryan Air pass *everything* onto the customer.  </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id=3>What is the relevance to Web Accessibility?  </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a><a href="#4" id=4>Please, this has nothing to do with web accessibility. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>Actually I think there are some potentially interesting legal ramifications </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6> if passing the cost of accessibility to the customer is found to be legal then it suggests a particular way to pay for what appeared to be already legally necessary accessibility improvements, at least in Australia and the UK.  </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>IIRC the airlines are customers of the airport, not the passengers. </a>
