<a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id=2>I think he has an open and shut case, but the outcome will be interesting, and I believe the airline and airport are only contesting the case as this sets a precedent to supply a reasonable service for all disabled travellers, world wide.  </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id=3>IIRC the airlines are customers of the airport, not the passengers. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a><a href="#4" id=4>They charge the airlines for the use of the wheelchair lifts, I don't think any other airline passes the charge on the customer, whereas Ryan Air pass *everything* onto the customer.  </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>What is the relevance to Web Accessibility?  </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6>Monarch also charge I believe.</a>

<a name="8">[8]</a><a href="#8" id=8>Take it up offlist.  </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a><a href="#9" id=9>You're right, offtopicitis has got me again. </a>

<a name="11">[11]</a><a href="#11" id=11>none really, but Freud would forgive the association of thought from Cynthia's posting. </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a><a href="#12" id=12>can you?  </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a><a href="#13" id=13>Naturally you are forgiven :)  </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a><a href="#14" id=14>Actually I think there are some potentially interesting legal ramifications </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a><a href="#15" id=15>But without providing some relevance to the topic of this list, which is web accessibility, I would prefer not to have more mail than I already get. </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a><a href="#16" id=16>Fora for general discussion of accessibility law are available...  </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a><a href="#17" id=17>in the USA it is expressly forbidden to pass the cost to the consumer.  </a>
