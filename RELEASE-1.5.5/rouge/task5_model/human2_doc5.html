<a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id=2>&gt; Please send regrets to the email lists. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id=3>Sorry about the delay, but this is the Techniques draft that I said I would do at the facetoface. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a><a href="#4" id=4>How about we have the following categories: </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>+ Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6>+ Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>+ Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a><a href="#8" id=8>+ References </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a><a href="#9" id=9>These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a><a href="#10" id=10>I agree. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a><a href="#11" id=11>I'd really like to work on emphasizing crossover situations in which doing one thing contributes to meeting several guidelines. </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a><a href="#12" id=12>In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met. </a>
