<a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id=2>I'm comfortable with whatever time is set and will remain flexible, even if it's 5:00am PDT. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id=3>Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a><a href="#4" id=4>Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion? </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>I would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that regularly attends the teleconference. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6>It is very difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at 4:00 pm EST would work for me but Tuesday or Wednesday would be better. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a><a href="#8" id=8>http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?day=6&amp;amp;month=6&amp;amp;year=2002&amp;amp;p1=250&amp;amp;p2=152&amp;amp;p3=195&amp;amp;p4=234 </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a><a href="#9" id=9> I do appreciate this gesture. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a><a href="#10" id=10>10pm Central European Time means I can make some of the calls, but not all of them, but I understand the change. </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a><a href="#11" id=11>does it help to have different times? </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a><a href="#12" id=12>According to the International Meeting Planner, Jutta's suggestion of 4pm EST is pretty good </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a><a href="#13" id=13>How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday? </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a><a href="#14" id=14>This would make it 6:00am in Australia and 9:00 pm in Europe. </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a><a href="#15" id=15>however, at glancing at her schedule she may have conflicts with this time, at least on Mondays/Wednesdays</a>
<a name="16">[16]</a><a href="#16" id=16>It's still Monday at 12:00 EST right? </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a><a href="#17" id=17>I believe 4.00pm on Tuesday would clash with the IMS meetings, if they continue at that time... </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a><a href="#18" id=18>3pm EST would be 5am in Australia and 9pm in Europe. </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a><a href="#19" id=19>Fyi, I'm back but Lou Nell is going to sit in on the next call for me  </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a><a href="#20" id=20>When did you need to make a firm decision? </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a><a href="#21" id=21>I hesitate to speak for Heather, but in her absence, the time is doable here in Pacific time; </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a><a href="#22" id=22>I don't think we should continue to ask her to do that. </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a><a href="#23" id=23> boring but maybe better for actual events? </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a><a href="#24" id=24>Hi Jutta, </a>
<a name="25">[25]</a><a href="#25" id=25>The same issue arose a few weeks ago in the PF group. </a>
<a name="26">[26]</a><a href="#26" id=26> although it is actually 10pm in Europe. </a>
