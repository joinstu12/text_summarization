<a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id=2>Don't know how long this meeting is going to take but with a joint meeting &quot;long&quot; seems more likely than &quot;short&quot;. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id=3>In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a><a href="#4" id=4>For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a levelA tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source). </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>Sorry I forgot to attach the file. </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6>Sorry about the delay, but this is the Techniques draft that I said I would do at the facetoface. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>&gt; + W3C plenary meeting (we may as well spend 10 minutes on this together since time is important for it). </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a><a href="#8" id=8>Tried to move it but that was just not possible. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a><a href="#9" id=9>I have another (phone) meeting coming up at 3:30 Boston time (1 hour after this one) so if we haven't finished by then, I'll have leave early. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a><a href="#10" id=10>So just in case: </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a><a href="#11" id=11>Cheers, </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a><a href="#12" id=12>&gt;  what does it mean for each group, how do we track it, resources for editing it? </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a><a href="#13" id=13>&gt; + Moving AERT work to AU group </a>

<a name="17">[17]</a><a href="#17" id=17>Hi all, </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a><a href="#18" id=18>I agree. </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a><a href="#19" id=19>+ Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a><a href="#20" id=20>A source editing tool can use this technique to any level. </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a><a href="#21" id=21>Language specific things have generally been removed (to be put in the separate docs). </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a><a href="#22" id=22>&gt; 2:30pm Boston time, 8:30pm France/Netherlands/Germany, 11:30am US West Coast... </a>
<a name="23">[23]</a><a href="#23" id=23>But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to doubleA. </a>
<a name="24">[24]</a><a href="#24" id=24>thanks for this </a>
