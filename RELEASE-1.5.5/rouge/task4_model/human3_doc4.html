<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>I view that anyone should be able to access information, regardless of whether or not they have a &quot;disability.&quot; </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6>Your access shouldn't be _limited_ because you have a certain quality about you that other people don't have. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>Regardless if we call that a &quot;disability&quot; or not, it should not interfere with your ability to access content on the Internet. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a><a href="#8" id=8>I think it's perfectly reasonable to define &quot;accessibility&quot; with having a strict definition of &quot;disability&quot; as long as your accessibility definition doesn't speak _only_ about access for people who fit that disability definition. </a>
