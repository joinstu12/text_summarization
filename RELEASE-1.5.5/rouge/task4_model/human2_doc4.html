<a name="2">[2]</a><a href="#2" id=2>Someone can be disAbled by a congenital defect, chronic illnesses or injury. </a>
<a name="3">[3]</a><a href="#3" id=3>It could be any combination of, or even multiple, congenital defects, illnesses and/or injuries. </a>
<a name="4">[4]</a><a href="#4" id=4>There are also debilitating side effects of medications. </a>
<a name="5">[5]</a><a href="#5" id=5>A &quot;nonreader&quot; is not necessarily blind </a>
<a name="6">[6]</a><a href="#6" id=6> they may have had a TBI (traumatic brain injury) or have a Learning Disability. </a>
<a name="7">[7]</a><a href="#7" id=7>Disabilities can effect fine and gross motor skills. </a>
<a name="8">[8]</a><a href="#8" id=8>A Quadriplegic may use different assistive technologies, such as voice pilots, mouth tools or devices that follow eye movement. </a>
<a name="9">[9]</a><a href="#9" id=9>IMO, before you can define Accessibility you must first define disability. </a>
<a name="10">[10]</a><a href="#10" id=10>Why? </a>
<a name="11">[11]</a><a href="#11" id=11>I view that anyone should be able to access information, regardless of whether or not they have a &quot;disability.&quot; </a>
<a name="12">[12]</a><a href="#12" id=12>Regardless if we call that a &quot;disability&quot; or not, it should not interfere with your ability to access content on the Internet. </a>
<a name="13">[13]</a><a href="#13" id=13>I think it's perfectly reasonable to define &quot;accessibility&quot; with having a strict definition of &quot;disability&quot; as long as your accessibility definition doesn't speak _only_ about access for people who fit that disability definition. </a>
<a name="14">[14]</a><a href="#14" id=14>A disability is a consequence of design flaws in the environment. </a>
<a name="15">[15]</a><a href="#15" id=15>I like to tell people that if a blind person can't access the web page she's trying to use, the REASON is not _her_ disability, but the disability of the _web author_ who created the page. </a>
<a name="16">[16]</a><a href="#16" id=16>That web author is &quot;disabled&quot; because he was _not able_ to make a correct web page. </a>
<a name="17">[17]</a><a href="#17" id=17>Why should she suffer for _his_ problem or failing? </a>
<a name="18">[18]</a><a href="#18" id=18>In no way is a user with a disability &quot;disabled&quot; on the web </a>
<a name="19">[19]</a><a href="#19" id=19> the sites THEMSELVES have the disability inherent in their code by not being accessible! </a>
<a name="20">[20]</a><a href="#20" id=20>We should identify the problem where it exists. </a>
<a name="21">[21]</a><a href="#21" id=21>The problem is not that there's anything &quot;wrong with&quot; the user, it is a problem with the page author and his output! </a>
<a name="22">[22]</a><a href="#22" id=22>I should like to add that we do have to accept that the victorians probably had an insuperable task in trying to design and build a wheelchair for a quadraplegic that the individual could control themselves. </a>
