This directory needs some more attention from someone who has worked on 
DUC.  For now, I'm including a simple duc->docsent script.  I'm also 
including Hong's manual summary->sentjudge scripts.

We have to determine how to make these exportable to other systems.  Some 
of the paths will need to be changed, the location of the idf database, 
etc.

Here are Hong's instructions for creating sentjudges from manual 
summaries:

The scripts for DUC 2002 and 2003 are not exactly the same because of
some differences in the file naming scheme. They might need changes
before you can use them. I specified all the path information inside
the script.  Please let me know if you want me to modify it in some
way.

Here is how to run the script for DUC2002:
go to /clair4/projects/duc03/hong/scripts/

./MUsentjudge.pl [cluster]
e.g., ./MUsentjudge.pl d061j

This will produce the sentjudge file for cluster d061j and put it in
/clair4/projects/duc03/hong/MUsentjudge.

For the script of DUC2003, similarly,
go to /clair4/projects/duc03/hong/scripts/

./MUsentjudge-2003.pl [task] [cluster]
e.g., ./MUsentjudge-2003.pl 2 d30003t

This will produce the sentjudge file for cluster d30003t and put it in
/clair4/projects/duc03/hong/MUsentjudge-2003.
