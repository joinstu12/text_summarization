Ok, I have made LexPageRank.pl a standalone script! 
Currently, it is located at:

/clair7/projects/nih/mead/bin/feature-scripts/LexPageRank.pl

The *.m files need ALWAYS go with it since LexPageRank uses 
matlab which in turn requires these *.m files.
LexPageRank.pl also uses these scripts written by Drago:
    /clair8/projects/pr-summ/getcos.pl
    /clair8/projects/pr-summ/all_cos.pl
    /clair8/projects/pr-summ/msaagam.pl  (this name probably need be changed)
    /clair8/projects/pr-summ/all_lev.pl
We'd keep them there intact!

Arguments to LexPageRank.pl are
    $cluster        (name of the cluster to summarize)
    $option         (either "cos" or "lev")
    $thresh         (0.1~0.9 for "cos" & even ints btw 2~100 for "lev")
    $datadir        (this arg would be appended by driver.pl, NOT user)

LexPageRank.pl would create the following files under $datadir/.. 
This is the dir where the .cluster resides:
    $cluster.sent    (original texts of extracted from the docsent files)
    $cluster.cos or $cluster.lev (depending on the option)
    $cluster-$thresh.cos.dat or $cluster-$thresh.lev.dat
    $cluster.commad  (matlab commad to compute LexPageRank)
    $cluster-$thresh.cos.pr  or $cluster-$thresh.lev.pr
        (actual data file for the given option and threshold)

Hence, the user of this feature script should:
    1. Make the cluster directory writable
    2. Be careful about file name confliction

Since this could be a very slow feature script due to the preparation work, 
the script is written in such a way that it always checks if required files 
already exist at each step. This would potentially yield a big time-saving.

An example meadrc file using LexPageRank.pl can be found at:
/clair6/projects/evolving-ie/fact-track/data/mds/A/cluster/A/lexpr.meadrc
Do:
% cd /clair6/projects/evolving-ie/fact-track/data/mds/A/cluster
% mead.pl -extract -rc A/lexpr.meadrc A

If you are the first one to run this, it will take a while for all dat files 
to be created. Subsequent runs will be much faster (but remember to remove 
the cached feature file A/feature/A.LexPageRank.sentfeature). 
You could modify
/clair6/projects/evolving-ie/fact-track/data/mds/A/cluster/A/lexpr.meadrc
to try other options and thresholds.

WARNING: running option "lev" could be super slow, especially for larger 
clusters since 50 .lev.dat files need be created!
