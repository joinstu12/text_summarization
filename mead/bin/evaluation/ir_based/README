kappa.pl and read_multi_into_kappatab.pl should both be documented already seeing as how they are both included in meadeval.pl.

spearman.pl:
input two docjudge files
first docjudge must be a "full-document" docjudge meaning that it must include the score of every document in the corpora while the second docjudge does not have to have that property.

pearson.pl:
same as spearman.pl


Maybe we should have something on what papers or algorithms these scripts were based so that people can go and read more about them.
