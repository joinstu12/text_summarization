In response to Iraq's noncompliance with UN weapons inspectors, Britain and the U.S. bombed Iraq just before Ramadan from December 16 to December 19, 1998.
The attack included off site cruise missile launches which targeted transport, air defense sites, and command and control facilities and hit several Iraqi hospitals.
Although a "concerted effort was made to minimize civilian casualties", 68 civilians were dead Saturday.
By the end of the bombing thousands were said to have been wounded.
Funeral goers denounced Americans as "enemies of God".
The Russia Foreign Ministry criticized solutions that "do not contribute to establishing suitable environments".
