From December 16th to the 19th, the first day of Ramadan, American and British forces bombed Baghdad in response to the Hussein government's countinued lack of cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
Deploying cruise missiles from B52 bombers launched from aircraft carriers offshore, the joint forces bombed several hospitals in Baghdad, including the largest, Saddam Hospital.
At the U.N. Iraqi officials declared that the bombings left at least 68 dead.
International criticism of the bombings was swift from Germany and Russia; the former voiced through the foreign ministry, the latter conveyed through the withdrawal of the Russian Ambassador to the U.S.
