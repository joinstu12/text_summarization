On December 16, 1998, the United States and Britain began a bombing campaign against Iraq.
This attack resulted from Iraq's refusal to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors.
At least 68 civilians were killed, and according to Iraq's UN Representative Nizar Hamdoun, thousands of people were killed or injured in the four day air strike.
Many area hospitals, including Baghdad's largest, were hit by missiles.
The Russian Foreign Ministry criticized the attacks, urging the United States and Britain "to refrain from carrying out any actions that do not contribute to establishing suitable environments" in which to resolve issues in Iraq.
