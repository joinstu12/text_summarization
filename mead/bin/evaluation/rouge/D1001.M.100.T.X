The US and the UK began a bombing raid in response to Iraq's refusal to comply with United Nations weapons inspectors.
The attack commenced and ended shortly before Ramadan -- a move calculated to prevent the anger of the Islamic world.
However, the raids, conducted by B52s and cruise missiles launched from aircraft carriers, still provoked the anger of the international community, particularly when it was discovered that at least four hospitals were struck.
Thousands of civilians were injured and 68 were killed during the bombing runs, whose funerals led to a procession denouncing America as the "enemies of God."
