All the rerankers I wrote for the CSTbank paper are in /clair2/projects/nie/nie3/cst-rerankers. The syntax is 
illustrated in test.sh in the same directory, and replicated below (this is a real example):

mead.pl -p 2 -reranker
"/clair2/projects/nie/nie3/cst-rerankers/cst-reranker1.pl
/clair2/projects/nie/nie3/data/10000000000001/10000000000001.metadata
/clair2/projects/nie/nie3/data/10000000000001/10000000000001.sentrel"
/clair2/projects/nie/nie3/data/10000000000001

Inside the double quotes is the syntax of the reranker itself, which of course can be different, depending upon how the 
reranker is written.

Explanation of the functionality of rerankers:

\subsection{Source-based rerankers}

News articles come from different sources, which may not be equally
reliable or interesting. Therefore the first pair of rerankers
reflects source preference.  Specifically, we arbitrarily arrange the
news sources in the order of ''CNN, ABC, MSNBC, USATODAY, FOX'' and
give each source an integer priority value $\Delta_s$ according to its
place in the list.

\begin{itemize}
\item In reranker 1, the score of each sentence s is {\em increased}
 by $\Delta_s$(source(s)).
\item In reranker 2, the score of each sentence s is {\em decreased}
 by $\Delta_s$(source(s)).
\end{itemize}

Rerankers 7 and 8 are very similar to rerankers 1 and 2
respectively, except that the $\Delta_s$ values are normalized
into the range between 0 and 1.

\subsection{Time-based rerankers}

The second set of rerankers reflects chronological
ordering. Specifically, we define $\Delta_t$ as the epoch seconds
corresponding to publication time of each article and use it to adjust
sentence scores.

\begin{itemize}
\item In reranker 3, the score of each sentence s is {\em increased}
 by $\Delta_t$(source(s)). Therefore more recent information is favored.
\item In reranker 4, the score of each sentence s is {\em decreased}
 by $\Delta_t$(source(s)).
\end{itemize}

Rerankers 9 and 10 are very similar to reranker 3 and 4
respectively, except that the $\Delta_t$ values are normalized
into the range between 0 and 1.

\subsection{CST-based rerankers}

With the aim of better understanding the role CST can potentially
play in the summarization process, we also built a set of
CST-based rerankers that utilize human-labeled CST relationships
in a relatively simple way. We view a document cluster as a graph
and each sentence as a node in it. Two sentences are linked by
arcs (for now only undirected) if they are CST-related. The number
of arcs are determined by the instances of CST relationships
between the sentence pair. For example, if  judge 1 finds one,
judge 2 finds three,  and other judges find no relationship(s)
between two sentences, there will be four arcs linking the
corresponding nodes. With this graph structure, each node
(sentence) has a degree as defined in graph theory, and denoted by
$\Delta_c$ in our scenario.

\begin{itemize}
\item In reranker 5, the score of each sentence s {\em increased} by
$\Delta_c$(s).
\item In reranker 6, the score of each sentence s {\em decreased} by
$\Delta_c$(s).
\end{itemize}

Rerankers 11 and 12 are very similar to reranker 5 and 6
respectively, except that the $\Delta_c$ values are normalized
into the range between 0 and 1.
