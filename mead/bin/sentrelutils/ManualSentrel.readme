1. Convert sentpair format (manually annotated CST relationships) to sentrel format

cat whatever.sentpair | /clair4/projects/sim/milan/txt2rel.pl JudgeName > whatever.sentrel

Example:

cat /clair4/projects/sim/milan/MI9-Zhu.sentpair |  /clair4/projects/sim/milan/txt2rel.pl Z > test.sentrel



2. Inter-judge agreement

(Both scripts in /clair4/projects/sim/milan/)

1) ijagree.pl sentrel1 sentrel2
        F--- fully agree
        P--- Overlaping judgement
        S--- One says something, the other nothing.

Example:

	ijagree.pl /clair4/projects/sim/milan/MI9-Zhu.sentrel /clair4/projects/sim/milan/MI9-Zhu.sentrel

2) ijagree-dir.pl sentrel1 sentrel2
This script specifically deals with the directionality issue. For all pairs that two judges give different 
directionality judgement, regardless of type, this script will print an "R" for them.
