Input: a cluster of documents defined by a .cluster file (assuming the docsent files are in the same dir)
	(Optional: a sentrel file for the corresponding cluster)

Output: 
- If sentrel is provided: P/R result for varous similariy approximation
- If sentrel is not provided: sentence pairs above specified similarity threshold


Syntax:

1) Similarity measures: one of the following:
	-bleu, -cosine, -wordoverlap, -lcs
2) Stopword deletion (on/off):
	-stopword StopwordFile.txt
3) Similarity threshold:
	-sthres RealValuedNumber
4) Similarity matrix (on/off):
	-matrix


Example:

Usage 1: evaluating similarity measures as proxy for CST-relatedness
 
	sim.pl whatever.cluster whatever.sentrel -cosine -sthres 0.1 -matrix

Usage 1: printing sentence pairs above specified sim threshold
 
	sim.pl whatever.cluster -bleu -sthres 0.2
