To install mead_lite all you have to do is:
open up mead_lite and goto like 12.
it currently reads:
$path = "/clair6/projects/meadserver";
what you have to do to make mead_lite run on your machine is type in pwd at the command prompt and remove /clair6/projects/meadserver/ and replace it with your pwd result.

for example:
$ pwd
/home/stu/mead_lite
will result in
$path = "/home/stu/mead_lite";


You should be good to go now.
