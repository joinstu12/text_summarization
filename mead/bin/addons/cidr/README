cidr.pl is a simple perl script which analyzes input files and groups them according to similarity of content.It takes one mandatory command line argument: a filename.  This file should contain the paths to all the files to be analyzed by  cidr.plOther optional arguments:	cluster number: numerical value defaults to 1,CIDR numerically orders the clusters it creates starting with the number 1, feed in a different number to start somewhere else.	threshold: numerical value defaults to .1.  Determines how similar documents must be to be placed in the same cluster.	word decay: numerical value defaults to .01.  This number  determines how quickly cidr discounts words which appear often	keep threshold: numerical value defaults to 3.  This determines the minimum nidf value of words in order to be added to the centroid or keywords of a cluster.	to keep: numerical value defaults to 10.  Determines the number of keywords to be kept in the centroid.	Other requirements:	cidr.pl requires that the files nidf.dir and nidf.pag be present in the directory where cidr.pl is executed.		cidr.pl expects the input files to be MEAD style docsent files.  Plain test files should also work, but are not guaranteed.		cidr.pl should be run in the directory where you wish the clusters to be created.		A typical call to cidr.pl would look like this: "cat ../ALL | ../cidr.pl" where ALL is the name of the file which lists all the input files.		cidr.pl will then create the necessary cluster directories and assign documents to each cluster.
