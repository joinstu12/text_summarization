   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Members of the public are reminded that more endangered species will be added to the protection list of the Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance starting from March 26 (Friday).</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a notice to be gazetted on March 26, the Secretary for Economic Services has ordered that Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance (Amendment of Schedules) Notice 1999 will come into immediate effect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Government spokesman today (Wednesday) said that the amended schedule was already gazetted in early February so that affected traders would have sufficient time to adjust to the changes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among those newly-added protected species are a number of commonly traded pet birds such as Hill Myna, Red-billed Leiothrix, Green Avadavat and Java Sparrow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Two plant species, Picrorhiza and Jatamansi, as ingredients of incense and herbal medicine; as well as all sturgeon species, some of which used in producing caviar, will also be brought under control.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spokesman said: "This means that the import or export of these species, their parts and derivatives will be subject to licensing control according to law.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The concerned species have been identified by parties of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) as requiring control on their international trade so as to prevent over-exploitation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Amendments are therefore made to put Hong Kong's legislative control in line with the CITES."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Also to become effective will be the Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species)(Exemption)(Amendment) Order 1999, which lists out the species exempted from possession licence under the Ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to facilitate implementation of the new control, the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) had issued a circular on the amendments to inform traders of related business.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spokesman also took the opportunity to reiterate that breaching of the Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance is liable to a maximum penalty of $5 million in fine and two years' imprisonment upon conviction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Enquiries on the new control can be directed to AFD's Endangered Species Protection Division on 2733 2283.</S>
