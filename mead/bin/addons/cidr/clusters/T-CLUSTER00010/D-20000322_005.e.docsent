   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fares on 11 licensed ferry services will be revised with effect from 1 April 2000 in accordance with the licence conditions for the operation of these services.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Three ferry operators viz.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='2' SNO='4'>New World First Ferry Services Ltd. (NWFF), "Star" Ferry Co. Ltd. (SF) and Discovery Bay Transportation Services Ltd. (DBTSL) have notified the Government that they will charge new fares on 11 licensed ferry services with effect from 1 April 2000 in accordance with the conditions of their ferry service licences.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='3' SNO='5'>The rate of increase ranges from 30 cents to $1.00.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, the adult fares in respect of six outlying island ferry routes serving Cheung Chau, Mui Wo, Peng Chau and Chi Ma Wan will be increased by 40 cents to $1.00 depending on the route, vessel type, class of travel and day of the week, while those on five cross-harbour ferry services will be increased by 30 to 50 cents.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"The new fares were specified in the relevant tender submissions for these routes which stipulated the fares for both the first and the second year of operation of the services.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='2' SNO='8'>These were taken into consideration in the overall tender assessment and subsequently formed part of the licence conditions," a Transport Department spokesman said.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"The new fares were made known to the public when the ferry service licences were granted in late 1998.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='2' SNO='10'>The licences took effect on 1 April 1999.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"In the case of NWFF which took over the operation of 8 licensed ferry services from the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Co. Ltd. in January 2000, the prevailing terms and conditions of these licences including the provision for new fares for 1 April 2000 apply equally to NWFF", the spokesman confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The operators will put up notices at ferry piers of the routes concerned about one week in advance to advise passengers of the new fares.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='2' SNO='13'>Passengers may also call the hotlines of the respective operators to obtain details -</S>
