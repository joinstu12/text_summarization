   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Members of the public are reminded not to bring back items of endangered species on their return from visits to other countries during the Christmas and new year holidays.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This appeal was made today (Sunday) by an Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) spokesman, who pointed out that some of the returning travellers were at times found by Customs and Excise officers at control points to have brought in endangered species.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Any person importing endangered species items without a licence would have contravened the Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='2' SNO='5'>This control measure also applies to all individuals including travellers," said the spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Statistics indicate that items seized from travellers at checkpoints include specimens of sea turtles, crocodiles, and monitor lizards, as well as corals, pangolins, ivory, parrots, eagles, owls and controlled medicines.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Any person found guilty of importing, exporting or possessing any endangered species, including their parts and derivatives, without a licence issued by AFD, is liable to a maximum fine of $5 million and two years' imprisonment," he added.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The spokesman also took the opportunity to urge members of the public to report any illegal activities on endangered species to AFD's Endangered Species Protection Section on 2733 2144.</S>
