   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Members of the public are reminded not bring back items of endangered species on their return from visits to other countries during the Christmas and New Year holidays.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This appeal was made today (Monday) by an Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) spokesman after the conviction of an air passenger on December 16.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A 48-years old Taiwanese was found by Customs officers to have in his bag a live gibbon when he was passing through Customs clearance on 14 December.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='2' SNO='5'>The man was charged and was fined $20,000 for illegal import of a live baby gibbon at a court hearing two days later.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No import or export of Gibbon is allowed except under very exceptional circumstances as the animal is a highly endangered species.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spokesman pointed out that some of the returning travellers were at times found by Customs and Excise officers at control points to have brought in endangered species.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Statistics indicate that items seized from travellers at checkpoints include crocodile meat, crocodile skin handbags, giant clam shells and coral skeletons from South-east Asian countries; parrots and bear bile powder from the Mainland and American ginseng roots from USA.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Any person importing endangered species items without a licence would have contravened the Animals and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='2' SNO='10'>This control measure also applies to all individuals including travellers," said the spokesman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Any person found guilty of importing, exporting or possessing any endangered species, including their parts and derivatives, without a licence issued by AFD, is liable to a maximum fine of $5 million and two years' imprisonment," he added.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spokesman also took the opportunity to urge members of the public to report any illegal activities on endangered species to AFD's Endangered Species Protection Division on 2733 2144.</S>
