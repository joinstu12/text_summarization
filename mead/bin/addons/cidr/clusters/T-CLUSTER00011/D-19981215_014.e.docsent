  </HEADLINE>

   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Transport Department today (Tuesday) announced that licences to operate various inner harbour ferry routes would be awarded to Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited, Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF)and "Star" Ferry Company Limited.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These ferry licences are for a period of three years, from April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2002.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A total of eight new town and inner harbour ferry services, grouped into five packages, were offered for open tender on October 30.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='2' SNO='5'>These services are largely supplementary services with convenient land transport alternatives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The objective of the tender exercise is to let market forces determine their viability, fare and service levels.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Transport Department received altogether eight bids from six companies when the tender closed on November 20.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited will be providing the Central - Tsim Sha Tsui East service under Package B, HYF will operate the North Point - Hung Hom and Kowloon City services under Package D, and "Star" Ferry Company Limited will run the Hung Hom - Central and Wan Chai services under Package E.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As for Package A, a spokesman for the department said there was only one bidder for the package, which comprised the Central - Tuen Mun ferry service and an excursion route serving Central, Tuen Mun, Sha Lo Wan and Tai O.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"We are still discussing with the sole bidder the vessel types to be deployed for this service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='2' SNO='11'>As there is only one bidder for Package A and most importantly, we would want to provide the successful bidders of the other inner harbour services with as much time as possible to gear up for their operation, the assessment for Package A will be conducted separately," he said.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"The package will be granted to the tenderer subject to its meeting the tender requirements," he added.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was no bidder for the North Point - Kwun Tong service under Package C.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"The North Point - Kwun Tong service is a loss-making service where patronage has been steadily declining over the past few years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='2' SNO='15'>Since patronage is low and convenient alternatives including MTR and buses are readily available, there should not be any significant impact on passengers or land traffic if the ferry service ceases operation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"We will monitor the situation and strengthen parallel services if necessary."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An inter-departmental assessment committee chaired by a Deputy Commissioner for Transport has been set up to assess the tenders.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Members included representatives from the Transport Department, Marine Department,Labour Department, Civil Engineering Department, Home Affairs Department, and the Independent Commission Against Corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The successful tenderers have been chosen on the basis of the level of service to be provided, the fares to be charged, the quality of vessels and passenger facilities, and the corporate and financial capability of the tenderers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All three successful tenderers are ferry operators experienced in providing ferry services in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Through competitive tendering, the market has found the levels of fares and services which could make the ferry services viable.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='2' SNO='22'>These levels are in general comparable with, and in some cases the fares are lower than, the existing ones," the spokesman said.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"For the Hung Hom Package, the proposed adult fare will be the same for the two routes - Hung Hom to Wan Chai and Hung Hom to Central.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='2' SNO='24'>Compared to the existing fares, the fares for the Hung Hom - Wan Chai route will be similar while the fares for Hung Hom - Central route will be higher.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"The current fares for the Hung Hom - Central route (now run by 'Star' Ferry) have been artificially suppressed through cross-subsidisation from 'Star' Ferry's other operation under the current franchise.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='2' SNO='26'>The service is not viable on the basis of the existing fare structure, and the tender result simply reflects what the market could accept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Even with the new fares, travel by ferry between Hung Hom and Central, and between Hung Hom and Wan Chai will remain the cheapest public transport mode," he added.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Transition is expected to be smooth in April 1999, with HYF retaining most of its staff for the North Point services, and "Star" Ferry retaining all of its staff for the Central - Hung Hom service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the other services, "Star" Ferry and Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited will make a first offer to HYF's existing staff to fill all available vacancies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The Government will provide all necessary assistance for the successful tenderers to gear up for operation to commence on April 1 next year," the spokesman said.</S>
