   <S PAR="1" RSNT="1" SNO="1">Review of HYF's franchise</S>
  </HEADLINE>
  <TEXT>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Chief Executive-in-Council today (Tuesday) directed that the present negotiations with the Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) and the Hong Kong Ferry (Holdings) Limited (HKF) on the pier development package at Central proposed by the companies should cease.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Chief Executive-in-Council also directed that HYF's present outlying islands, inner harbour and new town services, together with the Central to Hung Hom service operated by the "Star" Ferry Company Limited, should be grouped into different packages and put to public tender as licensed services.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Announcing the decision of the Chief Executive-in-Council, a government spokesman said HYF and HKF were requested on July 21, 1998 to give their written acceptance of the general terms of the pier development and ferry services package by the middle of August 1998.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>HYF and HKF confirmed on August 14, 1998 that they did not accept the terms.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='2' SNO='6'>HYF proposed to de-link ferry operations from the pier development project and indicated interests in operating selected segmented routes insofar they were financially viable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Speaking on the issue, the spokesman said, "Our immediate priority is to ensure continuity of ferry services, in particular the services to the outlying islands which have no land transport alternatives, should be maintained and further improved after HYF's current franchise expires on March 31, 1999.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Having regard to the changing pattern of ferry patronage and continuous improvement in land transport infrastructure, we consider that the more flexible mode of operation by way of a licence, which is normally granted for a period of three years, should be adopted to ensure provision of essential ferry services on the one hand, and to allow swift adjustment to the changing ferry services market on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Given different outlying islands may have different characteristics in terms of patronage, and service and vessel requirements, we decide to divide the six outlying islands routes into different packages and tender them out as licensed services to attract good operators who would like to focus on specific routes but might otherwise be deterred from entering into the market because of its size or the scale of investment required.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='2' SNO='10'>The approach would allow the Administration to widen the trawl for the best available operators.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"There is a strong interest in the market for ferry operations in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='2' SNO='12'>A total of 18 companies, including HYF, have submitted returns expressing an interest in operating different packages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Taking into account the commercial viability and geographical distribution, the six outlying islands services will be grouped into the following packages for a public tender - Central to Cheung Chau and Inter-islands services, Central to Mui Wo and Peng Chau, and Central to Yung Shue Wan and So Kwu Wan.¡¨</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>HYF's current franchise will expire on March 31, 1999 and the successful tenderer(s) will be required to operate the outlying islands services from April 1, 1999.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A gazette notice inviting tender submissions on these services will¡@be published on Friday (September 18, 1998), with tender closing at 10 am on October 12, 1998.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='2' SNO='16'>HYF and other operators would be free to put in their bids.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"In order to take care of HYF's staff that may be left redundant upon expiry of HYF's current franchise, we will make it a tender condition that if the successful tenderer(s) need to recruit new crew members and pier staff, a first offer of employment to the relevant employees of HYF to fill up the vacant posts available must be made on employment terms and conditions no less favourable than those prevailing in the ferry industry of Hong Kong," the spokesman said.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As regards the inner harbour and new town routes, it is the Administration's policy to rationalise these services since they largely provide supplementary services and there are convenient land transport alternatives.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='2' SNO='19'>They would be tendered out as licensed services in different packages and market forces will determine their viability, fare and service levels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Apart from HYF's six franchised inner harbour and new town services, the franchise of the existing Star Ferry's Central - Hung Hom service will also expire on March 31, 1999.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Taking into account the commercial viability and geographical distribution, the new town and inner harbour routes will be grouped into five packages for a public tender: Hung Hom to Central and Wan Chai; North Point to Kowloon City and Hung Hom; Central to Tuen Mun; Central to Tsim Sha Tsui East; and North Point to Kwun Tong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"Priority will be given to the tendering of the six outlying islands services and a separate public tender for the new town and inner harbour will be conducted shortly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"In arriving at the decision to go out for public tender, the Executive Council has considered carefully the need to ensure continuous ferry services to the outlying islands after March 31, 1999, HYF's submissions, the interests expressed by other operators, the desirability of enhancing healthy competition as well as the Administration's recommendation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='2' SNO='24'>To tender out HYF's franchised services in different number of packages is considered by the Council as the most suitable option in the public interest," the spokesman said.</S>
