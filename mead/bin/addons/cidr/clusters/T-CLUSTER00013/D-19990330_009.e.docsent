   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Transport Department today (Tuesday) announces that gearing up for the changeover of franchised ferry services currently operated by Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) is approaching the final countdown.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The transition will take place shortly after midnight on March 31 following the expiry of the franchise of HYF.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In reviewing the progress to-date, a spokesman for the department said: "Details of the logistics on the transitional arrangements have been finalised.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"These include the phased handing-over of piers and the setting up of a coordination centre to monitor the changeover."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Transport Department will activate a special Operation Coordination Centre (OCC) at its headquarters from 6 pm tomorrow to 9 am the next morning and from 4 pm to 8 pm on April 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spokesman said the coordination centre would maintain a close liaison with ferry operators and related government departments to ensure a smooth transition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"In addition, the department will deploy observation teams to major ferry piers to monitor service levels and passengers' demand on the first day of the changeover.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"More than 60 TD staff will be involved in monitoring the transition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"The department will put in their best effort to ensure a smooth transition and a satisfactory continuation of ferry services to meet passengers' demand," he added.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The current franchise of HYF will expire by the end of this month.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A total of 16 outlying islands, new town and inner harbour ferry routes, including the Central - Hung Hom ferry service now operating by "Star" Ferry Company Limited, were offered for open tender last year in eight packages.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All outlying island services, except those serving the Lamma Island, and the North Point - Hung Hom and Kowloon City ferry route will continue to be operated by HYF.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan services will be operated by Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry Company Limited (HKK).</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Central - Tsim Sha Tsui East ferry route will be operated by Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The "Star" Ferry will run the Hung Hom - Central and Wan Chai route while Tune Mun ferry services will be operated by Shun Tak Ferries Limited.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As the sole bidder for the North Point - Kwun Tong service failed to meet all essential tender requirements, this inner harbour ferry route will be cancelled from April 1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All ferry routes will be operated as licensed services for a period of three years starting from April 1 to March 31, 2002.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Overnight services will be provided to serve residents of Cheung Chau, Mui Wo and Peng Chau.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"For the outlying islands, ferry services will be strengthened with the provision of more ferry trips and a mixture of both fast and slow vessels to cater for demands of different passengers," the spokesman said.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The number of trips serving Cheung Chau will be increased from 58 to 80 while those plying between Mui Wo and Peng Chau will be strengthened from 49 to 60 and from 46 to 53 respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There will also be more trips for Yung Shue Wan (from 46 to 60 trips) and Sok Kwu Wan (from 20 to 22 trips) by HKK.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The spokesman noted that there would be considerable changes in the timetable, operating hours, piers as well as fares for the new licensed ferry routes after March 31.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>* Wan Chai-Hung Hom route: Wan Chai East Pier</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The spokesman reminded passengers, especially holiday makers, that they should check carefully in advance details of the sailings they want to take.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Passengers are also advised to arrive at the piers earlier in the initial period of the new operation to allow themselves to react to any unforeseen delay," he added.</S>
