   <S PAR="1" RSNT="1" SNO="1">Stricter control to protect endangered species</S>
  </HEADLINE>
  <TEXT>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Government has proposed to extend legislative control on the trade and possession of endangered species to include artificially propagated plants and medicines using endangered species as ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The proposed new controls will be contained in the amendments to the Animal and Plants (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking on the new arrangement today (Friday), a Government spokesman said: "The proposed amendments seek to meet the requirement of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"CITES control covers artificially propagated plants and medicines using endangered species as ingredients."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more commonly traded artificially propagated CITES-listed plant species include cacti, aloes, pitcher plants, venus fly-trap, rosary vines, cycads, cyclamens and orchids.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more usual types of endangered species parts and derivatives which can be used as ingredients of medicines include pangolin scales, bear gall bladder, seal penis, musk grain, saiga horn, crocodile meat, king cobra gall bladder, tuber of tall gastrodia, costas, dicksoniaceae species and aloes.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Trade in endangered animals and plants species and their products are already strictly regulated in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Under existing regulation, endangered species of plants of artificially propagated origin and products made from them are not yet subjects to control.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='2' SNO='10'>In the case of medicines, only those containing tiger or rhino ingredients are currently subject to control.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The proposed control measures are expected to take effect early next year.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Import shipments must be accompanied by CITES export permits.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For export shipments, export licences issued in advance by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department (AFD) will be required.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Traders in possession of such goods for commercial purpose must apply in advance to AFD for a possession licence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Government is now considering exempting such licensing requirement for possession if these traders are able to maintain an accurate transaction record up to the standard set down by AFD.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such records should clearly indicate the date and quantity of each transaction, with copies of invoices/ receipts attached and be available for inspection by the department.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>AFD has consulted representatives of local traders, including plant and Chinese medicine dealers, for their views on the proposed amendment to the Animal and Plant (Protection of Endangered Species) Ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A reminder has been sent to related traders early this month urging them to make necessary preparation for the commencement of the proposed control measures.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, the spokesman reminded traders that the new exemption arrangements would not be applied to medicines containing highly endangered species of wild origin as ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='2' SNO='20'>Their import, export and possession still require prior application of proper licences.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Local traders having further enquiries on the new measures can call AFD on tel: 2733 2379/ 2733 2282.</S>
