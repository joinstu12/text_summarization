   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking on the invitation, a spokesman for the department said: "The Government is now actively negotiating with HYF on the terms of its new franchise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"However, if progress is unsatisfactory, the Government may consider tendering out ferry services in a number of packages.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"The invitation to indicate interest is to gauge market's response in operating these routes."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The 12 routes, comprising mainly services for the outlying islands, Tuen Mun and the inner harbour, are grouped into seven packages.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are required to submit information on the companies' experience and competence in operating ferry services as well as the vessels available for deployment by April 1, 1999.</S>
