   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>* Ferry service(s) for Hung Hom, Wan Chai and</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Central</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Speaking on the tender exercise which was closed at noon today (Friday), a spokesman for the department said: "New town and inner harbour ferry routes are largely supplementary services.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"The objective of the tender exercise is to let the market determine the viability, fare and service levels of these routes."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An inter-departmental assessment committee chaired by a Deputy Commissioner for Transport has been set up to study and evaluate the tenders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The committee comprises representatives from the Transport Department, Marine Department, Labour Department, Civil Engineering Department, Home Affairs Department and the Independent Commission Against Corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Tender Assessment Committee will assess tenders on the basis of:</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>* fares and level of service proposed;</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>* suitability and quality of vessels proposed; and</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>* corporate and financial capability of the tenderer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spokesman noted that the department is satisfied with the overall response to the tender invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"It reflects considerable market interest in the operation of inner harbour ferry routes even in face of strong competition from cross harbour bus services and the Mass Transit Railway.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Selection exercise is expected to be completed by next month," the spokesman said.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ferry services under new operators will commence operation in April next year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, as there is no bidder for the North Point - Kwun Tong route, this ferry service will cease after its current franchise expires on March 31, 1999.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Patronage of the North Point-Kwun Tong ferry route is low and there are convenient road and rail transport alternatives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Therefore, discontinuation of the services should not have any significant impact on passengers and road traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"The Department will monitor closely the situation and strengthen parallel bus services if necessary," the spokesman added.</S>
