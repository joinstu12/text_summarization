   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Commissioner for Transport, Mrs Fanny Law, today (Tuesday) announced that the licences to operate various outlying islands ferry routes would be awarded to Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company Limited (HYF) and Hong Kong  Kowloon Ferry Limited (HKK).</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These ferry licences are for a period of three years, starting April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2002.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A total of eight routes, grouped into three packages, were offered for open tender in September.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>HYF will provide ferry services under Package I and II, while HKK will operate routes under Package III.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Package I comprises ferry services between Cheung Chau - Central, Cheung Chau - Kowloon Point (excursion route) and an inter-islands route.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Package II is made up of services between Mui Wo - Central; Mui Wo - Kowloon Point (excursion route) and Peng Chau - Central.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Package III covers Yung Shue Wan - Central route and Sok Kwu Wan - Central route which serve mainly residents of the Lamma Island.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Speaking at a press conference on the tender results, Mrs Law said: "The tender exercise has attracted a good turnout.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"It enhances competition and serves to widen the trawl for the Government to locate the most suitable operators for outlying islands ferry services."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Transport Department had received altogether 10 bids from six companies when the tender closed on October 12.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>An inter-departmental assessment committee chaired by a Deputy Commissioner for Transport had been set up to study the tenders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Other members included representatives from the Transport Department, Marine Department, Home Affairs Department, Department of Justice and the Independent Commission Against Corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Tender Assessment Committee evaluated tenders on the basis of:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>* the level and quality of services proposed;</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>* fares and passenger facilities proposed;</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>* suitability and quality of vessels proposed;</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>* the corporate and financial capabilities of the tenderers;</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>* the quality and fares of freight services proposed; and</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>* proposed marine contingency plans.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Mrs Law noted that the two successful tenderers are experienced operators in providing ferry services in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At present, HYF is running 12 franchised ferry routes and six licensed services, while HKK takes on three licensed ferry services.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Both HYF and HKK have committed in their bids the provision of quality ferry services at reasonable fares for passengers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"New vessels will be purchased.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='2' SNO='25'>The number of trips will be increased while journey time will be reduced with the employment of more high speed vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Ferry services for the outlying islands, which are essential due to a lack of land transportation alternatives, will be much improved, while fares will remain at levels similar to those of existing ones," Mrs Law said.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For instance, fare for each single trip to Cheung Chau, Mui Wo and Peng Chau from Central by fast ferries will be reduced from $24 to $20 in 1999 and $21 in 2000.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the employment of HYF staff, Mrs Law pointed out that HYF would retain most of its existing staff for operating these new licensed ferry services.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"HKK will recruit a number of HYF staff to fill all posts required to operate their new licensed services.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The number of staff to be recruited by HKK should not be less than those currently deployed by HYF for the same ferry services," she added.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Mrs Law assured the public that the Government would provide all necessary assistance for both companies in gearing up their operation to commence services in April next year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"We trust that HYF and HKK will cooperate with each other in ensuring a smooth transition.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Early meetings between the two operators will be arranged to discuss and firm up essential detailed arrangements," she said.</S>
