   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Transport Department announces today the operational details of the outlying island, new town and inner harbour licensed ferry services on April 1, 1999 and reminds passengers of the new timetables and fares of these services.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"After the expiry of the current franchise on March 31, HYF's outlying island, new town and inner harbour ferry services as well as "Star" Ferry's Central - Hung Hom service will be operated as licensed services by five ferry operators : HYF, "Star" Ferry, Hong Kong and Kowloon Ferry Company Limited (HKK), Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited (DBTSL) and Shun Tak Ferries Limited," a spokesman said.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"There will be considerable changes in the timetable, operating hours as well as fares on these services."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the outlying island services, except the Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan services, will continue to be operated by HYF after March 31.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='2' SNO='6'>The Yung Shue Wan and Sok Kwu Wan services will be operated by HKK.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='3' SNO='7'>These services to the Lamma Island will operate from Central Pier No. 5.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first ferry trip operated by HYF on April 1, will depart at 12.30 am from Central Pier No. 6 to Cheung Chau, while the first ferry trip operated by HKK will depart at 12.30 am from Central Pier No. 5 to Yung Shue Wan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"Overall speaking, more ferry trips will be provided to Cheung Chau (from 58 to 80 trips), Mui Wo (From 49 to 60 trips) and Peng Chau (from 46 to 53 trips).</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='2' SNO='10'>With the changes in timetable and with a mixture of fast and slow ferries service, passengers are advised to check carefully the sailings they want to take.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='3' SNO='11'>In addition, overnight trips will be provided to these outlying islands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='4' SNO='12'>The number of trips for the Yung Shue Wan (from 46 to 60 trips) and Sok Kwu Wan services (from 20 to 22 trips) will also be increased."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For the new town and inner harbour services, the operating hours will be similar to the existing services, but some of them will operate from different piers after March 31, e.g.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='2' SNO='14'>Shun Tak's Tuen Mun service will operate from Central Pier No. 4, "Star" Ferry's two Hung Hom services will operate from Hung Hom (South) Pier and HYF's Hung Hom - North Point service will operate from Hung Hom (North) Pier.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Passengers can later find the detailed timetable, operating hours and fares of all these licensed services at TD's Homepage (http://www.info.gov.hk/td/) as well as the homepage of HYF (http://www.hkf.com).</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='2' SNO='16'>Distribution of timetables on ferry piers will begin on March 23, 1999.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"As explained above, some of the ferry services will operate at different piers after March 31.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='2' SNO='18'>Though clear directional signs will be provided, passengers are advised to check carefully to ensure boarding the night service.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='3' SNO='19'>Given the considerable changes to the operational details, passengers are also advised to check carefully the timetable, operating hours and fares of the ferry services before they plan their trips," the spokesman said.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Although the transition of ferry services is expected to be smooth, passengers should arrive at the piers earlier in the initial period of the new operation and allow themselves more time to react to any unforeseen delay," he said.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Transport Department will operate a coordinating centre to ensure a smooth transition of ferry services.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='2' SNO='22'>The centre will be activated on March 31, 1999 and oversee the initial operation of the new services.</S>
