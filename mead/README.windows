This is a log of the steps I went through to install MEAD 3.11 on a Windows
machine running Cygwin and then get the meadd application to run.

Send questions to Tony: afader@umich.edu.

1 - Install Cygwin on your Windows machine. Make sure that you install all 
of the Perl packages, libiconv, gcc, and some sort of text editor.

2 - Download and extract MEAD-3.11.tar.gz

3 - Run the Install.PL script. This will most likely fail due to missing Perl
modules. I had to install HTML-Parser and all of its requirements to get this
to work. 

4 - Test MEAD:

    cd $MEAD_HOME/data
    ../bin/mead.pl GA3

If everthing was installed correctly, you should get a summary from the GA3
sample cluster. If you get errors about missing Perl modules, make sure that
you have installed them and that the dependent script can find them.

5 - Download and extract the mead server code. It is currently available in 
/data0/projects/meadserver.tar.gz.

6 - Install the JRE (this is needed for XSL transformations).

7 - Make sure the Windows firewall doesn't block port 6969 (to change this,
go to Start > Control Panel > Security Center > Firewall > Exceptions and 
add one for port 6969).

8 - Fix the Perl directive in $MEAD_HOME/bin/addons/cidr/cidr.pl and 
$MEAD_HOME/bin/addons/formatting/html2cluster.pl (these are on the TODO list 
for MEAD).

9 - Delete this line (line 195) in 
$MEAD_HOME/bin/addons/formatting/MEAD_ADDONS_UTIL.pm:

   <!DOCTYPE DOCSENT SYSTEM \"$DTD_DIR/docsent.dtd\">

The dtd creates Windows/UNIX path issues and is not absolutely necessary for 
running the mead server.

10 - Edit meadserver2/feature.hash so the paths to the feature scripts are
correct (the java demo only uses Position, Length, Centroid, and
SimWithFirst, so you will probably only need to change those).

11 - Edit meadserver2/classifier.hash as in 9.

12 - In meadserver2/meadd lines 328-333, edit the lines so they are:

    . "-IN `cygpath -wp $summarizedir/$directory/index.xml` "
    . "-XSL `cygpath -wp $xsltdir/response.xsl` "
    . "-PARAM id `cygpath -wp $directory` "
    . "-PARAM base `cygpath -wp $summarizedir/$directory` ";

"cygpath" is a program that converts paths into a format readable by Java
(which is running in Windows mode).

13 - Export the environment variables that meadd uses:

    export BINPATH=$MEAD_HOME/bin
    export PERL5LIB=/home/afader/mead/bin/addons/formatting
    for i in `ls meadserver2/xslt/xalan-j_2_7_0/*.jar`; \
        do export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$i; done

14 - Run meadd
    ./meadd
