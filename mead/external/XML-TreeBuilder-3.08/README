XML::TreeBuilder
----------------

This module uses XML::Parser to make XML document trees constructed of
XML::Element objects (and XML::Element is a subclass of HTML::Element
adapted for XML).  XML::TreeBuilder is meant particularly for people
who are used to the HTML::TreeBuilder / HTML::Element interface to
document trees, and who don't want to learn some other document
interface like XML::Twig or XML::DOM.


PREREQUISITES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.004 or better.  You will also need to have the XML-Parser and
HTML-Tree distributions installed.  All of these should be available
from CPAN.



INSTALLATION
