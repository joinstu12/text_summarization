<S SNO="9" PAR="9" RSNT="1"> Hurricane Gilbert swept toward the Dominican Republic Sunday, and the Civil Defense alerted its heavily populated south coast to prepare for high winds, heavy rains and high seas.</S>

<S SNO="10" PAR="10" RSNT="1"> The storm was approaching from the southeast with sustained winds of 75 mph gusting to 92 mph.</S>

<S SNO="11" PAR="11" RSNT="1"> ``There is no need for alarm,'' Civil Defense Director Eugenio Cabral said in a television alert shortly before midnight Saturday.</S>

<S SNO="12" PAR="12" RSNT="1"> Cabral said residents of the province of Barahona should closely follow Gilbert's movement.</S>

<S SNO="13" PAR="13" RSNT="1"> An estimated 100,000 people live in the province, including 70,000 in the city of Barahona, about 125 miles west of Santo Domingo.</S>

<S SNO="14" PAR="14" RSNT="1"> Tropical Storm Gilbert formed in the eastern Caribbean and strengthened into a hurricane Saturday night.</S>

<S SNO="15" PAR="15" RSNT="1"> The National Hurricane Center in Miami reported its position at 2 a.m. Sunday at latitude 16.1 north, longitude 67.5 west, about 140 miles south of Ponce, Puerto Rico, and 200 miles southeast of Santo Domingo.</S>

<S SNO="16" PAR="16" RSNT="1"> The National Weather Service in San Juan, Puerto Rico, said Gilbert was moving westward at 15 mph with a ``broad area of cloudiness and heavy weather'' rotating around the center of the storm.</S>

<S SNO="17" PAR="17" RSNT="1"> The weather service issued a flash flood watch for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands until at least 6 p.m. Sunday.</S>

<S SNO="18" PAR="18" RSNT="1"> Strong winds associated with the Gilbert brought coastal flooding, strong southeast winds and up to 12 feet feet to Puerto Rico's south coast.</S>

<S SNO="19" PAR="19" RSNT="1"> There were no reports of casualties.</S>

<S SNO="20" PAR="20" RSNT="1"> San Juan, on the north coast, had heavy rains and gusts Saturday, but they subsided during the night.</S>

<S SNO="21" PAR="21" RSNT="1"> On Saturday, Hurricane Florence was downgraded to a tropical storm and its remnants pushed inland from the U.S. Gulf Coast.</S>

<S SNO="22" PAR="22" RSNT="1"> Residents returned home, happy to find little damage from 80 mph winds and sheets of rain.</S>

<S SNO="23" PAR="23" RSNT="1"> Florence, the sixth named storm of the 1988 Atlantic storm season, was the second hurricane.</S>

<S SNO="24" PAR="24" RSNT="1"> The first, Debby, reached minimal hurricane strength briefly before hitting the Mexican coast last month .</S>
