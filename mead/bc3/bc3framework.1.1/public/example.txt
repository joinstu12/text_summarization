Dear Dr. Ebenezer Kuffour,
From reading your message I'm convinced this is a matter which requires confidentiality, credulousness, and much sneaking about.(Meta)
Of course I am interested in your business proposal.
If I understand correctly, you are short selling by 20% me a supply of alluvial gold (and you get 5% of the total amount of the discount for your efforts).
Please, I will need more details as to how to proceed from this point to the ultimate looting of my bank accounts.

Yours in Peace & Fertility,
Pierpont Emanuel Weaver, ESQ.

Dear Emanuel Weaver, 

Official export charges is $17,500USD per 50kg, as approved by the government. 
total export charges for 500kgs is $175,000USD.
I'm sure most of them can be worked out via conference call, email and FAX; although a face to face meeting in Ghana may be helpful.

Sincerely yours, Ebenezer Kuffour.
