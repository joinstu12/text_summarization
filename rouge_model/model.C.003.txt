Actually, the government is not robbing us of our rights, but protecting us. 
For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period.
