I'm comfortable with whatever time is set and will remain flexible, even if it's 5:00am PDT. 
Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday at 4:00 pm EST would work for me but Tuesday or Wednesday would be better. 
Fyi, I'm back but Lou Nell is going to sit in on the next call for me  
It's still Monday at 12:00 EST right? 
I would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that regularly attends the teleconference. 
This needs to take into account European time, Australian time and both east and west coast North American time. 
How is everyone with 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday? 
According to the International Meeting Planner, Jutta's suggestion of 4pm EST is pretty good 
I believe 4.00pm on Tuesday would clash with the IMS meetings, if they continue at that time... 
It is very difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone. 
10pm Central European Time means I can make some of the calls, but not all of them, but I understand the change. 
does it help to have different times? 
I will be in Europe for a few weeks soon and so we could have meeting times that suit the meetings
