Kynn's personal opinion, not one belonging to the WAI or the HTML Writers Guild  
Fearmonger and irresponsible journalist. 
He thinks he's found &quot;an issue&quot; and has latched onto it in order to &quot;save us from government,&quot; but really he's just a kook. 
The Freedom Forum's fear mongering aside, does anyone know what's up with the release of all the 508 accessibility regulations? 
Why did the feds take such a closeddoor approach when it was commonly expected that the info would be available on Feb. 7?
I don't see it as a closeddoor approach, though, the way I read their announcement. 
Maybe I'm just too trusting of gummit workers, but this seems more like typical bureaucracy slowness than any sort of concerted conspiracy to derive us of our rights. :) 
I think you are correct about the bureaucracy part. 
The linked announcement mentions that &quot;..the standards will be published in the Federal Register and be made available for public comment&quot;, so it sounds like it will eventually be opened up. 
Yes, a little Civics 101 is in order. 
The Federal Register _is_ the institution created expressly to make _sure_ citizens have the chance to comment on things before they are imposed.

That is a good question and should be asked of our next guest, Doug Wakefield on our march 16 web cast at abletv.net. 
I would add that any other questions you might want to ask doug, should be done on that evening. 
please check out the exact time for when the webcast will happen under the press release link at abletv.net. 
Actually, the government is not robbing us of our rights, but protecting us. 
i know this sounds paradoxical, but it is true. 
For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period. 
The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the   responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible. 
They do this with a limited staff.
