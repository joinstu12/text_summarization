Liddy has been admirably getting up at 2am on a regular basis to join our call. 
I would like to find an alternative time that works for everyone that regularly attends the teleconference. 
I believe 4.00pm on Tuesday would clash with the IMS meetings, if they continue at that time... 
It is very difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone. 
however, at glancing at her schedule she may have conflicts with this time, at least on Mondays/Wednesdays
