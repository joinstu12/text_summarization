We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html. 
ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them. 
This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th. 
I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home. 
I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints. 
Any time or venue should be fine with me. 
For 2004, when u prefer (best in mayjuly) we can host in Venice the F2F. 
If we can plan, what about planning the year, Australia included? 
Planning meetings a year in advance (at least tentatively) is a good idea.
