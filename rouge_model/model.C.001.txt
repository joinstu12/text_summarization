I need to help assemble and populate a small computer lab to examine web usability issues. 
This is a very large ballpark and I need to narrow the options we're going to explore.  
I'd like to hear about your opinions and preferences about tools if you care to share them. 
Please respond privately so I don't get shot for starting another browser war.  
I'd use Netscape 3.x and 4.x, a version of MS Internet Explorer (as you can't have two versions on the same machine to my knowledge), a text browser such as lynx., PwWebSpeak for the voice browser and maybe Opera if you have extra time and money. 
Also to be considered is the use of a general screen reader such as Jaws For Windows. 
Use of tools such as bobby and HTML validators is also essential. 
I would skip IE/Netscape, since designers worth 2c can tell you already how things work there by reading the code. 
The first thing I would do is validate the HTML and check with Bobby, but read the results and think about it rather than simply believing what you're told.  
For browsers I would look at Lynx, a screen reader (eg winvision, or jaws) and a proper audio browser like pwWebSpeak. 
If you can, use WebTV and a Macintosh version of things 
By the way, if you weren't aware, there's an emulator for WebTV that runs on Windows 95/* and Macintosh that you can download from developer.webtv.net. 
 this will generally show up the problems much faster.  
The key is to learn where the problems arise so you can cut back the test/repair cycle. 
It is a great efficiency if you can solve the problems by design rather than by repair.
