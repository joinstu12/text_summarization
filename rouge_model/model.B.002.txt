We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www.atia.org/conf_2004.html. 
I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th). 
Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings. 
For 2004, when u prefer (best in mayjuly) we can host in Venice the F2F. 
I have never had a holiday in Venice, although I would like to. 
I will add this to the agenda for the next call. 
I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home. 
I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints. 
Any time or venue should be fine with me. 
&gt; ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them. 
Matt May and Charles can confirm the good place for conference and holiday :) 
But I can confirm that it is a nice place to have a meeting, and could probably attend (it is not that hard to get to from Europe). 
 one should not show such enthusiasm, I suspect! 
Could we be careful to make the dates so that those of us who do come a long way can make it, please! 
best time for us is anytime
