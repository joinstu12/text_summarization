I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th). 
This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th. 
Monday is Martin Luther King day. 
What are your thoughts? 
Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor? 
I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it. 
I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ??? 
MLK Day is never better than in Savannah! 
Any time or venue should be fine with me. 
For 2004, when u prefer (best in mayjuly) we can host in Venice the F2F. 
But I can confirm that it is a nice place to have a meeting, and could probably attend (it is not that hard to get to from Europe). 
 one should not show such enthusiasm, I suspect! 
If we can plan, what about planning the year, Australia included? 
Planning meetings a year in advance (at least tentatively) is a good idea.
